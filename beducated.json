You feel like being at a friend\u2019s place where you meet like-minded, sex-positive people to talk about sexual taboos, fantasies, and stuff that really speak to a pussy connoisseur\u2019s heart.\n\n?FUCK YOUR BELIEFS ? I often find myself in the middle of conversations about sex (i wonder why\u2026?) and more often, I hear the following: \u201cEw! Why would you want to do THAT? Its so straight!\u201d or \u201cNo man, only fags do this! I\u2019m not a homo!\u201d or \u201cWhy would she want to do this? She\u2019s a lesbian! Otherwise go back to fucking men!\u201d or \u201cIts his job as a man to\u2026.\u201d??\u200d\u2640 . Did ya\u2019ll write some sex rule books that I\u2019m unaware about? #sendmeacopy . Lesbians who refuse to use phallic toys because its \u201ctoo straight\u201d; heterosexual men who wont let anyone near their ass with a 10 foot pole because its \u201cgay\u201d; women who wont swallow because \u201conly nasty porn stars do this\u201d; women who fake orgasms because \u201ctaking too long is selfish\u201d; men feeling inadequate because their woman masturbates. And seriously, did someone patent male anuses as a gay thing? #gayaf ? And poor lesbians who worry about all the dildos\u2026why not look at dildos as \u201cvagina shaped pleasure products\u201d? #vaginastick #pussytoy #cuntcucumber #vulvadong . Are you aware of different beliefs that you carry about sex? Just like you, I hold many beliefs surrounding my sexuality. More and more I become aware of how I keep myself from enjoying pleasure just because of some random thoughts in my head. #greatsexpectations .?\u200d\u2640 Here is a peculiar thing \u2013 we decided for ourselves what is good, bad, acceptable or nasty. And then we sit on our couch, our genitals on lockdown, until our lover submits to our sexual world view. Besides, they hold their own set of shitty beliefs. And so the world goes round and round \u2013 people inside their heads instead of each other\u2019s pants. #goals What you believe about sex, shapes your sexual relationships. You are what you think. Beliefs can be very damaging to your experience of pleasure. If you think that anal sex is painful/disgusting, it most likely will be for you. If you think that your woman masturbates because you are shitty lover, you probably are. . ?

This photographer knows how to capture intimate moments that you would love to hang on your wall.\n\nA fave frame from my one on one mentoring session this week! I love offering these one on ones because it\u2019s a way more intimate learning experience because it\u2019s all focused on you. We get to chill in a cafe for a few hours sipping chai, answering all the questions you\u2019ve been dying to know, going over your pricing, business strategies, and more! Then do a fun portfolio-strengthening shoot together in a gorg location that we take turns leading while I teach you how to direct and get people comfortable, and finally top the day off with some editing together and a portfolio + site review. If you feel like you learn better in a one on one setting rather than a workshop surrounded by tons of people (I know how it is trying to shoot in those settings where you\u2019re getting elbowed in the face trying to get the same shot that 20 other people are getting haha), then this might be a great option for you since we can do it anytime!

Maybe you find \u201cyourself\u201d in the gallery, have a look!\n\nVariations in vulvas are endless. Nature loves to play with diversity, making each and every one of us have a uniquely shaped vulva, all different in shape, size and colour. In about half of all vulvas, the inner labia are longer than the outer labia \u2013 and in the vulva depicted here you can see the inner labia \u201cpeek\u201d out on the front, being \u201chugged\u201d by the clitoral hood on top. The inner labia are purplish in colour \u2013 it\u2019s very common for the inner labia to have a different colour than the skin of the vulva around it. Also, the part of the labia that peeks out often has a darker hue (dark brown, purplish, or black) than the part enclosed by the outer labia. All these differences in colour can give your vulva a broad range in skin tones \u2013 like a mini rainbow in between your legs ?\u2728 #thevulvagallery #vulvalove #humananatomy #biology #diversity #bodydiversity #bodypositive #genderinclusivity #positivity #skintone #rainbow #sexualhealtheducation #letstalkaboutit #berespectful #bodylove #loveyourvulva #hildeatalanta\n\nEin Beitrag geteilt von The Vulva Gallery (@the.vulva.gallery) am 18.

{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>From So-So to Breathtaking: 11 Sex Hacks That Will Change Your Bedroom Forever\n\n\n\nMovies, porn and magazines tell us how a good sex life and even passion \u201cshould look like\u201d. But most of that\u00a0merely\u00a0touches the surface, plus does not do a good job\u00a0in terms of offering you good sex hacks, making you happier and more satisfied.\n\nSex is one of the most wonderful things we can experience in this world, and it should not be about\u00a0living up to standards set by the media.\n\nWe think you should get proper advice. That\u2019s why we asked the best Sexperts out there to share their best sex hacks\u00a0with you.\n\nWe asked everyone:\n\n\u201cWhat is your #1 proven sex hack for a breathtaking sex life?\u201d\n\nAnd these are their answers:\n\nfrom majwismann.com\n\n\u201cBe honest and be brave. These are two things you should never ever stop practicing. In order to develop sexually, you need to be brave. Tiny, little steps are fine but these won\u2019t happen without the courage. Remember the first time you had to kiss someone? I\u2019m sure you felt like you were about to die from feeling so nervous. The first time you had sex? I\u2019m sure you felt pretty nervous then too and had to muster up some courage.\n\nThis is exactly how things continue to happen even when we grow up! Your sexuality wants to develop itself your whole life and it can only do that if you\u2019re brave and if you\u2019re willing to take tiny, little steps out of your comfort zone and allow yourself to feel safe in whatever new place you enter.\n\nBe sure to take baby-steps. It\u2019s not necessarily about trying out a million new things \u2013 sure, you can do that too \u2013 what\u2019s important is that you start to react on the lust you feel and the desire burning inside, and stick to it(!), even though sometimes you\u2019ll get rejected. It might be something like how you want to kiss more during sex but you\u2019ve never really found the right way to do so.\n\nA good sex life isn\u2019t about doing all this new stuff all the time.\n\nA good sex life is about learning to enjoy receiving and learning to enjoy giving \u2013 and to own up to what you like, both in giving and in receiving.\u201d\n\nfrom letgoletgoddess.com\n\n\u201cMy number 1 proven sex hack for an amazing sex life is a connection with myself. My relationship with myself determines how all others connect to me, including my lovers. If I am not integrated within, my sexual connection with a partner will be disconnected. I must connect to myself lovingly and sensually so when I show up with a partner, I am already full and ready to be taken to the next level.\n\nWhen I started loving on myself, I began to attract different types of partners who reflected my self-love.\n\nThat\u2019s when my sex life became mind-blowing! All others are just our mirrors.\u201d\n\nfrom intimatepower.com\n\nMy secret to breathtaking sex is knowing to have great sex with yourself. Daily self-pleasuring is literally the best advice I could give anyone, and one that has sex changing, orgasm-changing, and life changing effects for my clients. I\u2019d recommend women avoid vibrators and too much clitoral stimulation to become more sensitive.\n\nMen should avoid ejaculation at the end of self pleasuring to not only last longer but experience expanded orgasms.\n\nI also recommend not to watch porn and thus gain a healthier and pleasure-full sex life.\n\nfrom\u00a0practicalintimacy.com\n\n\u201cFuel Your Desire. Invest in the things that turn you on in life, in your relationship and in the bedroom. What does that look like? Do the things in life that you\u2019re passionate about.\n\nThe things that make you feel powerful, magnetic, sexy, juiced-up and desirable. This energy carries forward into how you show up in all areas of life, especially your sex life.\u00a0Actively feed desire for your partner. Focus on the qualities you find so attractive in them. Maybe it\u2019s the way they make you laugh, the incredible way they light up a room, or the soul warming cuddles they give. Cultivate a mindset of appreciation and worship.\n\nPrioritize sexual connection time and then protect it with a vengeance.\u00a0Invest as much love, passion and energy into sexual connection as you would the other areas of your life \u2013 be creative, try new things and stay curious. Remember to treat yourself too. New sheets, new toys or new locations all add a vital bit of spark.\n\nWhen you start to actively feed your desire in this way \u2013 desire for life, desire for your partner, desire for breathtaking sex \u2013 you begin to unlock a truly amazing sex life.\u201d\n\nfrom thepolyman.com\n\n\u201cOne of the best sex hacks I know is what I call \u201csimmering\u201d.\u00a0As monotony sets into relationships, many couples fall into the coercive pattern of \u201cI\u2019m red hot right now and my partner is ice cold, so I have to somehow persuade them into arousal\u201d (or more often than not, acquiescence). This ends up feeling \u201cmechanical\u201d or like \u201cwork\u201d for both partners, and is a libido and satisfaction killer.\n\nIn order to avoid this, we need to actively seduce our lovers \u2013 not just up until we get what we want. This is easily done by \u201csimmering\u201d.\n\nImagine heating up a pot of water on a stove. There\u2019s a bunch of steps to setting it up and then you turn the fire on low and wait. Eventually, it\u2019s no longer cold; the water is active and warm, but not close to boiling. At any time you can get it to boil \u2013 simply turn the heat up and seconds later the water boils.\n\nThe simmering approach is the same. An active and satisfying sex life requires a low barrier to entry\u2026 the easier, quicker, and readier both partners are to have sex, the more sex you will have. It\u2019s obvious, but crucial. By keeping a low-level of arousal and excitement constant a majority of the time, you no longer have to \u201cturn on\u201d your partner every time you want to have sex \u2013 just up.\n\nThis is done throughout the day with little tidbits of seduction, usually suggestive, rather than hyper explicit. By a light, continuous flow of authentic displays of sexual affection, you keep the sexual tension active over hours and days \u2013 not just minutes leading up to intercourse.\u201d\n\nfrom jennaward.co\n\nThe #1 hack to an amazing sex life is to put sex at the top of your to-do list.\n\n\u201cMore often that not we are just \u2018too busy\u2019 for sex. Sex isn\u2019t seen as productive, so everything and everyone else keeps being prioritized above it. Our heads keep telling us to be/do/have more while our hearts + wombs forget the medicine of presence + pleasure that only sex can help us embody.\n\nWhether it\u2019s sex with yourself, or with another, embodying the belief that you are never too busy for sex is a sure fire way to have more spontaneous, heart opening sex, at the slightest sign of being turned on.\u201d\n\nfrom fragmentsofevolution.org\n\n\u201cBreathe. This may sound deceptively simple, but don\u2019t let yourself be fooled. Or even better: observe your breathing pattern during sex. You will notice that, in certain moments, you hold the breath or breathe shallowly. Time to change that!\n\nHolding the breathing during sex stops the circulation of sexual energy and prevents relaxation. It is one of the main causes of premature ejaculation, anorgasmia, and a host of other sexual dysfunctions. We tend to stop breathing during sex because of our inability to cope with intense stimulation\u2026 and intense pleasure! Yes, stopping the breathing is a \u201cdefense mechanism against pleasure\u201d.\n\nBreathing shallowly, on the other hand, can produce a certain excitation and a superficial arousal of the sexual energy. It can be fun in certain situations, but a shallow breath does not allow us to experience the deeper and more fulfilling orgasmic states.\n\nWhen you are making love, try to breathe deeply, slowly, and with awareness.\n\nIf you notice that your partner is holding the breath, ask him/her to breathe deeply as well. You will notice a powerful shift in your lovemaking. Pleasure will start running abundantly through your body, even as you feel more relaxed than ever. And if you want to make it even juicier, try sounding your exhalations. You can sigh, moan, cry, whisper, or chant! Use the breath as your ally, and your sex life will almost instantly upgrade.\u201c\n\nfrom awakenthecervix.com\n\n\u201cMy sex hack would be to slow it all right down.\n\nGive a LOT of time to opening the female body\u2026let it be a relaxed process rather than one with a destination.\n\nIf penetrating the vagina, go very slowly, so you can feel everything. We want to move away from friction based, hard fast sex so we can develop more sensitive awareness and therefore more pleasure. When you go slow and take the goal of the table, sex can go on for a long time\u2026you can even have a tea break. ;)\u201d\n\nfrom sofiasundari.com\n\n\u201cSex free of agenda. Sex free of performance. People tend to have very specific ideas about what sex should look like and what pleasure should feel like. For many sex it\u2019s all about thrusting, sweating, pumping and humping. Then reaching a peak (hopefully), cuddling a little (maybe), smoking a cigarette and falling asleep.\n\nThis is a mainstream view of sex, this is what we learn from movies, porn and other \u201csexual education sources\u201d available out there. What most people associate with sexuality, with erotic and therefore with orgasm is really only a tiny little fraction of what it really is.Tantra teaches us that there is really no end to the depth of erotic opening.\n\nEven though someone may seem totally erotically free, there is always more\u2026 Because essentially what we are opening to is our true Self, it is the Universe, it is a space of no separation, it is God.\n\nSo the \u201csex hack\u201d is to stop defining sex and projecting our expectations on what is a good orgasm.\n\nBecause the degree and depth of your orgasm depend on how open you are to life. First and foremost be present with your partner. Get out of our mind. Be in your body. Be present with the energy between the two of you. Listen to it. Don\u2019t force things. Don\u2019t rush into penetration. And let your mind be blown. Because when there is sexual energy, there is always room for magic.\u201d\n\nfrom mysticsex.com\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rush! Fully connect with each other first with transfiguration (eye gazing) or meditation. Double your foreplay time, keep eye contact, synchronize your breathing and slow it down. Kiss your partner all over. Communicate more \u2013 tell them what you like and how it makes you feel. Build up the anticipation.\n\nThe more you can take your time, the more the intimacy can build, allowing you both to go deeper.\n\nWomen normally take longer than men to arouse and climax so go at her pace and share the ecstasy together. You\u2019ll both feel much more connected and when she\u2019s feeling more connected she\u2019s able to open more and experience greater pleasure! In my opinion, this is one of the fundamental keys to deeper orgasmic bliss.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d say communication is my number 1# hack for an amazing sex life.\n\n\u201cOf course, breathtaking sex starts with this gut feeling, this crazy lightening sensation starting in your belly and going up und down your spine when you see this person that triggers desire and lust in you. But we all know chances are slim that the sex that \u2013 hopefully \u2013 follows will be amazing without any words spoken. That only happens in the movies \ud83d\ude42\n\nSo in my experience great sex starts with a proper, sexy mind fuck \u2013 with words. Knowing how to flirt, knowing what to say to get the other one in the right mood. Then, formulating your desires, being able to vocally steer sex the way you want it and not being afraid to ask what your sex partner desires from you. Expressing that you are having a wonderful time during sex, dirty talking, saying that you are about to come.\n\nAnd last but not least communicating afterwards, telling your sex partner how good it was, what you enjoyed most, what maybe did not feel so great and what you would like to do next time.If both people involved communicate, sex will start off great and can cultivate into mind-blowing experiences.\u201d<|endoftext|>"}

If you are up for the challenge, we have curated an incredible series of spectacularly sexual tasks for you to try over the course of the next month.\n\nEach challenge is a taster from our ever-growing library of sex courses! And we thought, what better way to introduce (and seduce) you to the variety of what we teach \u2013 and get a sensual flavor of the benefits.\n\nWe created this for you to prioritise your pleasure each day. Just see if you notice a difference by the end of it.\n\nThere are so many benefits to incorporating sex into your daily routine, including:\n\nSome tasks can be enjoyed alone, and some with your partner \u2013 and it\u2019s totally up to you how you incorporate them into your regime. We\u2019d recommend that you factor in about 15 mins of your day to each challenge. Oh, and save enough downtime to revel in the afterglow.\n\nInstead of focusing on orgasms, make pleasure your aim. And remember, it\u2019s okay if you skip a few days \u2013 just take joy in looking forward to having fun. Let us know how you get on via our social media channels #31DaysOfPleasure @_com.\n\nTap into your sensual side with a Breast Massage Ritual. Whether you are massaging your own breasts, or your partner\u2019s, this healing and detoxifying practice can increase breast size and firmness. It can also help to prevent cancer and enhance your overall pleasure. Follow how to make this the most sensual experience with this step-by-step guide.\n\nThis position is great for a lazy afternoon, as not much energy is needed, but it is wonderfully tantalizing! Taken straight from our Kamasutra Sex Guide, the penetrating partner lies on their side, propped up on a pillow, the penetrated partner lies on their back, legs swung over their partners hips.\n\nJust like you would spoil your partner with a back massage, this relaxing penis massage technique will leave them feeling blissfully aroused. Starting from the root of the shaft, press the penis with thumbs and index fingers. Stay for a moment then release \u2013 moving up a finger width and repeat.\n\nAs the weather heats up (depending on where you are in the world), send chills down your partner\u2019s spine with this Kinky Sex tip. Hold an ice cube in your mouth to torture and tease their skin, choosing which erogenous zones you want to arouse.\n\nMonogamy isn\u2019t for everyone, but neither is Polyamory. But did you know there are more types that could describe your relationship style. Learn about the advantages, disadvantages and different styles in our Poly Relationships 101. Discuss with your partner what you think describes you best \u2013 and maybe what your ideal style would be.\n\nThough this practice is found in our Lingam Massage course, this is not about massaging or touching the penis at all. Using your eyes, body language and words to worship your partner\u2019s (or your own) penis. Gaze lovingly at the lingam to build a sense of connection and eroticism.\n\nCan you resist the temptation to touch?\n\nWith or without a yoni egg, target your pelvic floor and mindfully tense and release your muscles to create strength and increase your pleasure potential. Whether you have a penis or vagina, anyone can enjoy these Yoni Workout Positions, or for a more interactive experience, follow-along with our Yoni Egg Video Course.\n\nBefore entering the vagina, make sure it is all lubed up, aroused and engorged (tips: gently stimulate the clitoris and nipples to turn yourself or your partner on).\n\nWhile inside the vagina, press on the wall at 12 o\u2019clock, let go and move to 1 O\u2019clock, and so on. At each \u201ctime\u201d, notice (and communicate) if there is pleasure, numbness, pain or tension and breathe through it. Release and moan to reap the healing and arousing benefits of this Yoni Massage technique.\n\nWhen going down on your partner, this Blowjob technique will undoubtedly have them drooling for more. Squeeze the shaft while working your tongue over the head of the penis. Experiment with pressure, movement, and the shape of your tongue. Get creative, but also communicate and listen to what they want.\n\nNow\u2019s the chance to explore your kinkier sides. Alone, or with a partner, set some time to recall and write down your favorite fantasies. You can choose to share them by reading them out. Before you do, create an open-minded atmosphere that is free from judgement. And remember, they\u2019re just desires \u2013 you don\u2019t have to act them out unless you both enthusiastically want to.\n\nLocate the space between the genitals and the anus, gently vibrate your fingers, fist, or use a vibrating toy, to vibrate and stimulate the perineum. This Lingam Massage technique is great for indirectly activating the prostate \u2013 offering up the chance for a deeper and full-bodied climax.\n\nThe beauty of wearing a blindfold is that it allows you to focus your attention inward, creating an almost meditative experience. By cutting off the sense of sight, all other senses are heightened. Head to our Kinky Sex course for more inspiration for playing with sensation.\n\nUse this day to worship your partner\u2019s vulva. Or, grab a mirror and use this time to worship yourself! Again, this practice is not about massaging or touching the yoni. Just gaze lovingly at the yoni to build a sense of connection and eroticism. Notice what you feel during this experience. It can be a very vulnerable experience, so go gently.\n\nLayer your body up with gloves, socks, lingerie, a naughty outfit (you know the one). Set the scene with some sensual music (or whatever mood you feel like stripping to). Lock eyes with your partner, confidently and erotically. Slowly peel off each item, piece by piece.\n\nYou can also do this practice solo \u2013 in front of your mirror \u2013 and put on a sensual show for yourself!\n\nBefore you start, make sure you set a timer (this could be anywhere from 3 minutes to 20 minutes), boundaries and safe words (eg.

It\u2019s a question we get asked all the time, and one of the first things I recommend is playing a sensual sex game with your partner. It\u2019s the perfect form of roleplay and is guaranteed to get your blood pumping. And if you\u2019re competitive, it could get quite naughty.\n\nI wanted to share some of my favorites with you. Most of these games don\u2019t require any accessories, but if they do, I\u2019ve made a list of what you\u2019ll need. These couples sex games are all simple to play and can help even the shiest of people get in the mood.\n\nWant to find out more about your partner\u2019s fantasies? Here\u2019s a great way to do it.\n\nYou and your partner both write down five fantasies on slips of paper and throw the slips into a bowl. Shuffle the paper around and get into bed. Taking turns, each of you draws a piece of paper from the bowl, and you talk about the fantasy. You\u2019ll learn more about each other and you\u2019ll both be really turned on by the end.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A bowl\n\u2013 Ten slips of paper\n\u2013 A pen\n\nEver wanted to sleep with a firefighter, a convict, or a policeman? Role-playing will let you live out that fantasy.\n\nA tried and true sex game, it\u2019s the best way to spice up a relationship. Dress up and pretend to be whatever you want. One of the most common scenarios is the teacher-student relationship. She can dress up as the teacher and he has to put in some \u201cextra work\u201d to pass.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Costumes and props\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling naughty, you\u2019ll love the dirty talk that comes with it. A dirty twist on a classic game, ask each other dirty would-you-rather questions. Eventually, you won\u2019t be able to keep your hands off of each other. Who knows, maybe he\u2019ll finally give you a mind-blowing g-spot orgasm!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Dirty thoughts\n\nAnother classic, although you might want to stick to dares for maximum pleasure. This is a great way to subtly tell your partner what you\u2019re into. Dare each other to do naughty things you wouldn\u2019t have the courage to ask for otherwise. This is the perfect chance for you to get out of your comfort zone!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Creativity\n\nWant to find out more about your partner while having some fun?\n\nAsk each other questions (personal questions or trivia questions work), and whenever someone gets an answer wrong, they have to drink and take off a piece of clothing. You\u2019ll be naked in no time.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Sexy lingerie\n\nWant to keep your man excited all day long? Throughout the day, leave sticky notes with sexy messages throughout the house for your partner to find. It\u2019s a good way to build tension, and eventually, you won\u2019t be able to resist ripping each other\u2019s clothes off.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Paper and a pen\n\nFood and sex go hand in hand, and this game proves it! The blindfolded partner has to feed the other ice cream, and if any ice cream falls onto their body, the blindfolded one has to lick it up. You could also use chocolate sauce. Yum!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A blindfold\n\u2013 Your favorite ice cream\n\nThis is the perfect game for those who are into rough sex or conscious BDSM! You\u2019ll need some ropes, scarves, or even handcuffs to play. Tarzan\u2019s goal is to pin Jane down, tie her to the headboard, and penetrate her with their penis or a strap on. Try and fight off your Tarzan. Give it five minutes and you\u2019ll both be hot and horny!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Ropes or scarves\n\nHave you ever wanted to pretend to be a porn star? Reenacting porn is a great way to try new positions. Consider skimming through the video beforehand to make sure it\u2019s something you\u2019ll both enjoy.\n\nBtw, I recommend making it look like a feminist porn! You\u2019ll understand why once you check it out.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Something to watch porn on\n\nThis is for the exhibitionists out there. Take a walk wearing a thin t-shirt with no bra, while your boyfriend wears loose shorts with no underwear. If you want to be seen, walk into a store. When you get home, your adrenaline will be pumping and you won\u2019t be able to resist each other.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Revealing, sexy clothes\n\nYou don\u2019t want to have any regrets when you get older? Then work on your sexual bucket list. Make a bucket list with sex acts you haven\u2019t done (or look one up online) and knock something off of the list. Some things you could try include having sex outside, learning Tantra or having a threesome!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A bucket list!\n\nAre you ready to reveal some of your deepest, darkest secrets? Play a game of never have I ever, but keep it sexual. You\u2019ve never been tied up before? Prepare to be! You\u2019ll find out things about each other you didn\u2019t know and maybe end up trying some new things before the night is over.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A willingness to try new things\n\nIf you want every inch of your body worshipped, this is the game for you. You think of a spot on your body, and your partner has to kiss every part of your body until they find it. Another thing you can do is just let them kiss you everywhere before stopping them. Neither one of you will complain. Mmmm!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 The desire to be touched\n\nForget poker, play this sexy card game on your game night. First, you have to give each suit a different sex act. For example, hearts could be oral, and spades could be penetration. The number on the card is how many seconds you have to perform each act.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A deck of cards\n\nLie on the bed naked and play with yourself, using toys if you\u2019d like. Your partner has to stand at the doorway, and for every question they get right, they can take a step closer. When they get one wrong, they have to take a step back.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Sex toys\n\nThere\u2019s nothing better than spending quality time with your boo. You and your partner masturbate next to each other, and whoever cums first has to help the other finish. The person who came first gets to request a sex act for round 2.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Porn and sex toys (optional)\n\nYou and your partner stand facing each other, and taking turns, touch each other (I suggest kissing, licking, and touching certain areas. Leave oral and penetration for the finale). The receiving partner has to mimic on you what\u2019s been done to them. It\u2019s a good way to non-verbally tell your partner what you like.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A dirty mind\n\nThis is the ultimate way to build tension, and we all know that it\u2019s the recipe for a satisfying climax.\n\nSet the timer on your phone to 20 minutes and fool around with each other. During those 20 minutes, no penetration is allowed. The prolonged teasing will leave you very excited.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Self-control\n\nThere are no set rules for this game. All that matters is you and your partner have some sort of physical contact. I recommend naked wrestling, tickle fights, or naked pillow fights. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll both be sweaty and ready to go. The one who surrenders has to do whatever the winner likes.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Pillows\n\nDo you like a challenge? Want your partner to impress you? Pick a sex toy and get your partner to try and make you cum with it. I recommend nipple clamps, fleshlights, vibrators, and dildos for the most fun. Whether you climax or not, it\u2019ll be great foreplay.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\n\u2013 Your favorite sex toys\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure how to spice up your night, you\u2019ll love his. Throw all of your sex toys into a bag, close your eyes, reach in and grab one. Whichever sex toy you pull out is what you and your partner are using for the night. This is a great way to ease the pressure of picking a sex toy.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A bag or basket\n\u2013 An assortment of sex toys\n\nThere are a few different ways you can play this game, and here\u2019s one of them. You and your partner get naked, one of you hides while the other seeks. When they find you, they get to do whatever they want to your body.\n\nAnother way you could play is to both go on opposite ends of the house, blindfold yourselves, and try to find each other using your voices while talking dirty.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Somewhere to play\n\nKeep your partner guessing with this game, which involves a blindfold. One person is blindfolded and the other guides their hand to a point on their body. The blindfolded partner has to guess what they\u2019re touching. The longer you tease each other, the better the sex will be.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A blindfold\n\nBoth you and your partner get naked, and using body-safe paint, draw on each other. You\u2019ll learn to appreciate every single part of each other\u2019s body. For added fun, use edible paint and lick it off of each other. Mmm.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Body paint\n\u2013 Paint brushes (optional)\n\nSpeaking of how amazing your body is, did you know that there are 8 types of female orgasms?\n\nA small dose of jealousy is one way to have great sex. Have your partner tell you about someone they\u2019re really into and describe what they would do to them. A more extreme version for secure relationships is to both go out on a date with someone else, come home, and talk about it. It could lead to some really passionate sex.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Confidence\n\nAnother great way to get to know your partner, especially if you have a specific fantasy in mind. Simply talk about your fantasies with each other and try to make one a reality. You might be surprised to hear what your partner is into!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Whatever the fantasy requires, possibly costumes and sex toys\n\nSex is exciting because it activates all of our senses. And by playing this game, you\u2019ll get to focus on everything besides sight. Blindfold one (or both of you) and simply get down to business. Your other senses will be heightened, and you can let your imagination run wild.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A blindfold\n\nThere\u2019s something sexy about the prisoner-guard scenario. The dom-sub relationship in this game is bound to turn you both on.\n\nHandcuff your partner (or have them handcuff you) to a bedpost naked and make your way with their body. Whatever you want, you get. After all, they\u2019re the prisoner.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Handcuffs\n\nMost people don\u2019t take the time to really appreciate their partners, which is unfortunate. I recommend you try this game. It\u2019s more exciting than you\u2019d think. Each of you sits on one end of the room and pleasure yourselves, resisting the urge to touch each other.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Sex toys\n\nHave you ever wanted to fool around outside? The feeling if possibly getting caught turns most people on. If you\u2019re feeling dangerous, drive to a public parking lot (not too public!) and fool around. You don\u2019t have to have penetrative sex. Simply touch each other and have oral sex. Whatever you\u2019re comfortable with!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A car\n\nThis requires a bit more set-up but has the potential to be really sexy. Go on a picnic at a semi-private park, eat some great food and enjoy some wine, and fool around a little bit. Touching each other outside will get you riled up, and when you get home, you won\u2019t be able to resist ripping each other\u2019s clothes off.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A picnic basket\n\u2013 Some delicious food (bonus points if you pack aphrodisiacs)\n\nWant to enjoy a snack and your partner\u2019s body at the same time? Blindfold your partner and start putting things in his mouth. Start with food and move into body parts. Fruits are the best option, as they aren\u2019t too messy and you get to lick the juices off of each other! Whenever they guess right, you have to switch roles.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A blindfold\n\u2013 Delicious food\n\nGetting competitive with your partner is one way to build tension, and when you pair that with alcohol, great sex is inevitable. Take a wild trip back to your college days and play beer pong, but with a twist. Instead of (or alongside!) drinking beer, the loser has to remove a piece of clothing.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Red solo cups\n\u2013 Beer\n\u2013 A pong ball\n\nRegain that feeling you felt when you were young and made out with someone for the first time. This is a twist on the game you know you played when you were younger, but more R-rated. You have 7 minutes to get in and get out of the closet. The pressure could result in a really sexy, sweaty experience.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A closet\n\nWant to build sexual tension while enjoying a movie or your favorite series? When you and your boo are watching TV, use the commercial breaks or the beginning and end credits to fondle each other. After your show is over, you\u2019ll both be so turned on that you\u2019ll have to have sex right away.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 TV\n\nIf you enjoy being submissive in bed, this game is for you. Make a list of all the things you did wrong during the day and give it to your man. Have you spank you with his hand or even a paddle, punishing you for being naughty. Create a safe word just in case!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A piece of paper\n\u2013 A pen\n\nAnother one for the exhibitionists out there! Take a hike through the forest, and halfway, stop and fool around. There\u2019s something about having sex outside that gets the blood pumping. I don\u2019t know about you, but I love giving a blowjob in the forest!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 A forest\n\nTurn your boo on with your sexy acting skills! This is like regular charades, but instead of acting out innocent things, you\u2019re acting out sex acts. Get creative and use different props. Just watching each other is enough to really turn you on. And if your partner guesses what you\u2019re doing, they get to make it a reality!\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need:\n\u2013 Costumes and props\n\nYou might also like: 4 Steps to Sparkle-Up Your Sex Life \u2013 Thank You Neuroscience!\n\nSex is an important part of your intimacy. That\u2019s why I wanted to share these games with you. It\u2019s often as easy as playing a simple game to get you and your partner in the mood. In the kink world, sex is called \u201cadult play\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what it should be \u2013 fun!\n\nThere\u2019s a game on this list for every type of person, or be inspired to come up with your own. Once you get over that first bit of embarrassment, you\u2019ll start to enjoy yourself and your sex life will flourish.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Ancient Sex: 19 Creative Ways How Our Ancestors Got Laid\n\n\n\nRacy gay sex, letting your partner cheat during your marriage and having sex in your underpants. So, what do these bizarre sounding deeds have in common? They are just some of the weird and wonderful ancient sex rituals that we are going to look at from around the world.\n\nWhether it was ancient pre-Islamic Arabs lending out their wives or ancient Roman\u2019s having sex in the streets until they stopped from pure exhaustion, our ancestors not only got laid, but they were more fluid and open with their sexuality than many of us would ever imagine.\n\nFrom Cleopatra\u2019s homemade vibrator to the Ancient Romans\u2019 obsession with brothels \u2013 let\u2019s look at 19 of the most creative ways our ancestors got their rocks off.\n\nThe women in Ancient Babylon were anything but holy.\n\nAccording to Greek historian Herodotus, every last woman who lived in Babylon made her way to the brothel at least once in her life\u2026 Apparently, men would choose whatever woman they wanted to have sex with, and the woman would treat the sex as a holy service to god.\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2026 forget LoveHoney!\n\nLadies in the ice age were getting their rocks off with, literally, rocks.\n\nThe ancient dildo was actually found in Germany in 2005 and scientists believe the ancient sex toy is between 26,000 to 28,000 years old. Our ice age ancestors weren\u2019t shy either \u2013 the penis shaped rock measured three centimeters wide and 20 centimeters long\u2026carry on, ladies!\n\nTurns out the Emperors in Ancient China were so busy that they had to keep a sex schedule. Yep, an ancient sex schedule. Some historians believe the schedule was so an Emperor could rotate his sexual encounters with different women, and women were scheduled according to their rank in society.\n\nI know what you are thinking, sounds like a lot of work \u2013 luckily for them, they actually had secretaries to do their schedules.\n\nSounds a bit familiar right? (cough, Handmaid\u2019s Tale anyone!?) But, in Ancient pre-Islamic Arab times, husbands would lend out their wives to get them pregnant to a more \u2018prestigious\u2019 male.\n\nNot all was bad though \u2013 the children that were made out of this bizarre ritual were considered to be the original husband\u2019s, not the man of \u2018prestige\u2019.\n\nIn Ancient China, Taoists genuinely believed ejaculating too much would kill them. Their thought process was kinda justified.\n\nThey believed a losing too much of their \u2018jing\u2019 (the essence of life) would kill you.\n\nAnd, you guessed it, cum held the most jing. This meant the men would stop themselves from ejaculating when they were having sex.\n\nAlright, we all get creative in the sack sometimes\u2026 But, we are pretty sure Cleopatra takes the cake with rumours of her homemade vibrator. Turns out when Cleopatra was on a dry spell, she would take things into her own hands \u2013 she would fill a box full of bees and treat herself.\n\nEven though it\u2019s pretty well known the Ancient Greeks were into their gay sex, it\u2019s lesser known that gay sex was everywhere in ancient times. We mean it \u2013 everywhere.\n\nFrom Greece to Rome to China, everyone was getting their gay on.\n\nAnd there was nothing special about it either, in fact, it was pretty normal. Greeks may have taken it a little too far though; sexual encounters between men and boys were, shall we say, not uncommon.\n\nFor centuries in the Ancient Egyptian Siwa tribe \u2013 gay marriages not only existed, but they were the norm. Turns out, in the tribe, grown men could marry young boys after giving their fathers a gift, and a man could have a boy as his own along with about four wives. But don\u2019t let the ratio fool you \u2013 some historians have noted that most of the fights in the tribe were a result of competing for same-sex attention.\n\nTalk about relaxing \u2013 the Mayans came up with 19 different sex positions specifically for the hammock. The Mayans used hammocks to keep off the ground and away from snakes and other creepy crawlies \u2013 so they creatively found a way to make their antics in the bedroom work in the swinging bedroom.\n\nNot exactly an early day Tinder, but it turns out in 18th century England, the average Englishman could simply pick up a local guidebook and search for a prostitute that tickled his fancy. Some of the guidebooks have somehow been salvaged, and the ladies are described in detail. Here\u2019s a sneak peak; one is described as having \u2018a delicate hand at stroking\u2019 and another is \u2018rather remarkable in having a fine Roman nose\u2019. Keeping it PG, boys!\n\nAnother weird one from Ancient China; Taoists believed that having sex with loads of virgins would make them immortal.\n\nApparently, the younger the better.\n\nSome historians have written that Taoists truly believed having sex with virgins between the ages of 14 to 16 would give them a better shot at immortality, as older women began to lose their ding (similar to jing in #6).\n\nOn the island of Inis Beag, Ireland, sex was so heavily frowned upon that it was only done in missionary position\u2026 with as much clothing on as possible.\n\nAnd, as long as it was done as quickly as possible.\n\nIf this ancient sex approach doesn\u2019t sound tempting enough, wait for the foreplay \u2013 light kissing and if you were lucky, a touch of the butt. No oral \u2013 don\u2019t even think about it.\n\nIf you thought Cleopatra was creative with her bee-box vibrator, wait until you hear about the Ancient Chinese cock ring. The first ever recorded version of a cock ring was in 1200 AD in the Jin and Song dynasties, and folks made the ring using goat\u2019s eyelids and eyelashes. The lashes apparently not only gave extra stimulation, but kept the penis erect for longer. Sexy!\n\nIn Ancient Rome, sexual activity was so open and prominent that sometimes people were having sex on the streets to the point of exhaustion. A downside of this was the massive amount of sexual slavery that went on in Ancient Rome.\n\nBut still, walls from Pompeii to Rome were found with tales of ancient sex marathons.\n\nLike \u2018\u201ca soldier from the 7th legion was here. Tonight he satisfied 6 women, and even that is not much for such a stallion\u201d.\n\nThe Romans are at it again \u2013 this time with their own currency for their prostitutes. Turns out, brothels were so popular in Ancient Roman times that a currency was based purely on brothel sex positions.\n\nRumour has it they were to pay the prostitutes in the brothels, as one side of the coin would have a certain sex act on it \u2013 and the other a number. Historians believe this was to show how much each sex act was worth in value.\n\nInfidelity is allowed during the Pon Festival in Indonesia.\n\nThe festival is actually a centuries-old ritual where couples meet up near a shrine \u2013 to have sex with somebody else\u2019s partner. It is supposed to bring good luck, but only if the new \u2018couple\u2019 has sex seven times (every 35th day). Sounds like pretty hard work for a festival.\n\nIt might not be a massive surprise that Vikings weren\u2019t the most sexually open of people. Their foreplay pretty much went like this \u2013 a man turned toward his wife and placed his leg, arm or thigh on her\u2026 nothing more! The most explicit term to come out of Viking culture? Brolta a maga.. Or, \u2018romp on her belly\u2019. Very saucy.\n\nFor some church-goers \u2013 it was either missionary or penance. It was thought a man\u2019s position was on top and a women\u2019s underneath, and those caught breaking \u2018gender\u2019 roles were sentenced to a penance of up to 3 years.\n\nNo cowgirl and doggy style, folks.\n\nCan you imagine walking along a river, and for some reason there is a load of guys masturbating into it?\n\nWell, welcome to Ancient Egypt. In Ancient times, Egyptians believed the god Atum created the universe with his sperm. Yep \u2013 before his birth nothing existed apparently. Because of this, Pharaohs would publicly masturbate into the Nile so it would continue to flow with water. Okay then?\n\nThere you have it folks \u2013 from 26,000-year-old dildos to getting down and dirty on a hammock, our ancestors seriously thought outside the box when it came to getting laid. And while some of these rituals sound fun and kinky, we don\u2019t recommend a DIY vibrator like Cleopatra, homemade cock rings or masturbating into rivers!\n\nIf you found this article interesting, you might also like:\n\nThe *One* Principle of Tantric Sex That Everyone Should Know\nWhy Do Women Have Rape Fantasies?

There was banana flavor, grape flavor, Pi\u00f1a colada, and the list went on.\n\nThe problem was that these types of lubes were usually filled with ingredients that mess with your natural pH balance. Oh, and they nearly always tasted like dessert mixed with a side of chemicals. Yuck.\n\nLuckily today, edible lubes have been revolutionized. The difference now, is that flavored lubes taste way better. And, I am convinced it\u2019s because most edible lubes these days don\u2019t contain toxins or harmful ingredients. Win for the pH too!\n\nThe truth is, not all lubes are created equally, and for good reason. Unfortunately, there are still synthetic edible lubes available on the market that contain a bunch of harmful ingredients that you wouldn\u2019t want to put in your mouth, let alone in your vagina.\n\nSo, how the heck do you choose the best flavored lube that is non-toxic and gentle enough for your intimate bits?\n\nTo eliminate some of the stress in finding the most organic and best flavored lube, I have scoured the market for you. Below are my top picks for some of the tastiest and arousing lubricating lubes on the market.\n\nOh, lubrication. It\u2019s something you don\u2019t really think about until you really need it. That is to say, there is nothing pleasurable or comfortable when putting anything up a dry vagina or butt. Um, ouch? So most people will agree that a good amount of lubrication is vital for pleasurable sex.\n\nMoreover, if you are interested in anal sex, a personal lubricant may be very handy. That\u2019s because, unlike the vagina, the anus isn\u2019t self-lubricating.\n\nAside from making sex more pleasurable, the right amount of lube may not only feel good, but also decrease the likelihood of transmitting or acquiring sexually transmitted diseases when used with a condom. In fact, the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control states that \u201cLubricants can increase pleasure and lower the chance that a condom will break with penetrative sex. Lube helps condoms move easily move around on the skin, making sex safer and more pleasurable.\u201d\n\nSo, while most of us naturally produce a decent amount of lubrication, depending on the time of the month, hormones, etc., the pleasurable amount of lubrication doesn\u2019t always happen. So, if you find that you rarely moisten when aroused, or perhaps just want to experiment with different levels, a personal lubricant can help.\n\nOn top of that, edible lubes are a delicious, kinky, and creative way to bring more intimacy between you and your partner! Just imagine all the body parts you can drool and nibble on.\n\nChoosing a flavored lube is like walking into a candy shop, I mean, where do you even begin? Well, just like you have your favorite type of candy, I can almost guarantee you will eventually have your favorite type of flavored lube too. It all comes down to what feels and tastes good for you! So let\u2019s look at the \u201cbase\u201d of the most common lubricants on the market are:\n\nIf you want a blend of both worlds, there is also an option of using a hybrid lube. A hybrid lube is a blend of silicone and water-based formulas. Either way, knowing what base your lube contains, will help you choose the right texture, slip and slide for your most exquisite parts. So, now that we know the bases of the most common lubricants, let\u2019s go ahead and add a little flavor, shall we?\n\nSure, the idea of peanut butter edible lubricant sounds delicious. That is, unless you have a peanut allergy. So, just like you would want to review the nutrition facts for the food you buy everyday, you will want to do the same when choosing an edible lube.\n\nIdeally, before choosing a lube, look at the ingredients. If an edible lube is flavored with foods, or chemical additives that you have a known allergy to, then it will almost certainly cause an allergy to your lovely bits as well.\n\nThat being said, what are the top ingredients to avoid? Nonoxynol 9, Petroleum-based, glycerine, and propylene glycol. But why, you ask? Well, if you are the type of person that doesn\u2019t want toxins in your hand moisturizer, then you certainly won\u2019t want them in your private parts either.\n\nAnd, according to a study conducted at the University conducted by researchers from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada in 2018, they have linked these sneaky little ingredients can lead to inflammation, irritation and other vaginal infections such as yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis. No thanks!\n\nI suggest choosing a flavored lube that is pH balanced for vaginal health, and at least free of the four ingredients listed above.\n\nHeads, shoulders, knees, and toes. Really anything goes when it comes to flavored lube. As long as it\u2019s nontoxic and free of the ingredients I mentioned above, go ahead and get wild with it!\n\nWith that said, water-based lubes can be used with male condoms, female condoms, sex toys, or simply applied on the vulva, anus, and fingers to make any sexual experience much more pleasurable. Oh, and here\u2019s a tip, if you don\u2019t want things to get too messy, consider laying down a towel before you experiment with flavored lube.\n\nIt is also best to warm up a bit of lube on your fingertips before applying it to your preferred body part.\n\nWhether it\u2019s solo play or partner play, begin to apply a small amount to your nipples, labia, clitoris, or anus. Slowly, but surely you will be able to figure out right away what amount works for you.\n\nYou can go ahead and get creative and sassy with your lube and use it for sex play aside from oral sex such as applying edible lube on your lips for sultry kisses.\u00a0You can also experiment with partner massage, or use the lube for some hot and heavy self-love. Think of it as a deliciously tasting masturbation session!\n\nSo, now that we know how to use our lube, let\u2019s get right down and slippery.\n\nFlavored Lubes\n\nI love this flavored personal lubricant because it doesn\u2019t soak into the skin too quickly. In other words, a little bit of Peppermint Tingle Aloe Cadabra goes a long way.\n\nWhat\u2019s more is that this lube is a favorite among women who are prone to vaginal irritation. That\u2019s because this lube is super gentle and made from 100% vegan ingredients. And yet, it has just the right amount of kick to stimulate the senses!\n\nFlavored Lubes\n\nI have to say that this is one of my favorite lubes, simply because it tastes so darn good! Plus, the super silky texture makes me want to go again and again.\n\nIt\u2019s also not sticky and lasts without having to reapply after every sex circuit. If you love the smell, and taste of berries and are looking for a lubricant that doesn\u2019t contain any synthetic ingredients, I definitely recommend Maple Holistics Natural Berry Flavor Lubricant.\n\nFlavored Lubes\n\nAlthough a bit more watery than other flavored lubes, The Muse Cafe Salted Caramel is bursting with flavor and is silky smooth. It\u2019s free of toxic ingredients and made for people that may be sensitive to other lubes.\n\nMoreover, The Muse Cafe Salted Caramel Lubricant is known for being slippery, not sticky \u2026 which means everlasting wetness, even after multiple applications.\n\nFlavored Lubes\n\nThis lubricant goes the extra mile when it comes to sex play. Simply put, JO Gelato Creme Brulee lasts forever, no matter how long sex or masturbation lasts.\n\nIt\u2019s also great because it\u2019s not too watery, not too sticky, and it has a great consistency. Even more, the smell and taste are delectable .. I mean who doesn\u2019t dream of eating creme brulee while having an orgasm?!\n\nFlavored Lubes\n\nThis flavored personal lubricant tastes super yummy and smells great. Unlike other lubes, it has no residual smell or taste of chemicals, so you will never feel like you are swallowing something that you shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nHonestly, though, this lubricant is so delicious, and it\u2019s also nice and slippery. The only drawback to this lubricant is sometimes the bottle cap can be faulty. Which means you have to pay extra attention when you store it away.\n\nAt the end of the day, all we ask for in an edible lubricant is that it tastes and smells great. Oh and that it\u2019s free from yucky chemicals. Because who wants to put anything other than simple, and natural ingredients in and on their anus, vagina or penis? Not me. Taking all the edible lubes into account, for me, the clear winner is the flavored peppermint Aloe Cadabra Organic personal lube.\n\nWhile the other lubricants are free of most harsh chemicals, Aloe Cadabra is 100% vegan and free from every type of toxic element. Also, I find the peppermint flavor to have just the right amount of \u201ckick\u201d to get me hot and stimulated. But, for those who find the flavor to be too strong, they also offer it in different flavors such as french lavender and strawberry flavored.\n\nTo sum it up, all the lubricants I listed above are definitely sex-worthy.\n\nIf you want a lube that really tickles your senses, silky smooth, and made with all organic ingredients, I suggest, however, starting with the peppermint Aloe Cadabra Organic personal lube. It\u2019s an exquisite and delicious way to seduce and satisfy your lover \u2026 or, more importantly, yourself. Enjoy!<|endoftext|>"}

Maybe you have even gone online or into a store, seen how many options there are and freaked out a little? Yeah, I did that too.\n\nThere are so many to choose from! And that\u2019s because there is actually a lot to consider when it comes to getting the right set. But the right Kegel balls do exist, it\u2019s just that the right one is entirely personal and will differ between women.\n\nWhen it comes to finding the best set of Kegel balls for you, you should start by understanding the different styles available. Although there are some styles more suited to beginners and others to advanced users, there are no strict rules around this.\n\nI\u2019m sure you recognize this name right? Kegel balls is the term that is now used to describe Kegel exercises as a group but it is also a specific type of ball. These are a great starting point for beginners as they are generally coated with a layer of silicone that connects the balls.\n\nAs a loose rule, these are usually larger in size and less heavy than other styles too. Always check out the specific measurements and size before you buy. You can also find sets that come with different weighted balls. This means you can swap out to the heavier options as you get stronger.\n\nThis is another classic style and is likely what most women think of when they hear the term Kegel balls. Benwa balls are two individual balls that can be inserted separately or together and do not have anything connecting them.\n\nThey are more difficult to keep in the body as they are usually on the heavy side and made from smooth, slippery materials like stainless steel, glass or some sort of gemstone. While this makes them durable and easy to clean, I would not recommend them for beginners.\n\nThey are a great option to progress to once you have some experience under your belt. Pun absolutely intended! These bad boys are also\u00a0more difficult to remove and may require some fishing around inside your body to get a good grip on them. But, they will seriously work your pelvic floor!\n\nDuotone balls are basically Kegel balls with some added stimulation to make the workout a bit more exciting. They are hollow balls with smaller weighted balls inside them. These roll around and stimulate your vagina as you move.\n\nThe outer ball is typically made from silicone or plastic, while the inside ball is metal to give it more weight. Most duotone balls will be connected like Kegel balls and have a string that hangs outside of the body which makes removal nice and easy.\n\nIf you are looking for some stimulation along with your pelvic floor strengthening, then this will be your best bet. Don\u2019t expect too much of these little babes, as although there will be some sensation, it\u2019s not super intense.\n\nNow, I know you have heard of this one!\u00a0Yoni eggs are all the rage right now and honestly, for good reason. Yoni eggs are known for not only strengthening the PC muscles and pelvic floor but also helping to heal our bodies from the inside out.\n\nThey also create a deeper connection with our bodies and our own sexual energy.\n\nWhere do I sign up? Yoni eggs are made from smooth cut crystal and are a single egg-shaped ball. This is a more natural option for women that like to really connect with their body while they exercise.\n\nForming a habit is hard work, but using an app to track your progress can make the process a bit easier. Ah, technology you wonderful thing!\u00a0App-controlled exercisers are exactly what they sound like.\n\nThey are a set of Kegel balls, or a single ball, that connects with an app to understand your progress as you train. These balls tend to be made from silicone and they measure the amount of pressure that your PC muscles apply to the ball when you squeeze.\n\nThese are perfect for people that need a little encouragement when it comes to exercising. Plus, they give you all sorts of amazing benefits and information that a regular Kegel ball can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the type of Kegel balls you use that is important. There are a bunch of other factors to consider before you buy too. While the type of Kegel ball that you want may determine some of the following for you, it\u2019s important to still keep them in mind.\n\nMost of the complaints from females I know tend to be based around not getting it right the first time. They start out with balls that literally fall out straight away. This means that the balls are too small or too heavy.\n\nRemember that the smaller, heavier balls are the most difficult to keep up. If you are a beginner, then look for a medium to a large ball that is nice and light. However, if you haven\u2019t had children, then its recommended that you start with a smaller ball. Just make sure it\u2019s not too heavy.\n\nKegel balls come in all sorts of materials but each style tends to have specific types that they use.\n\nKegel balls and duotone balls will usually have a silicone outer and plastic balls, Benwa balls are made from harder materials like glass, stainless steel or gemstone, Yoni Eggs are made from crystal or gemstone and app-controlled toys will generally be made from silicone.\n\nThe most important thing is to pick a material that is body safe and non-porous.\n\nIf you feel that you have some real work to do down there, then a training kit may be the best option for you. These will generally come with interchangeable weights so you can build your strength and work your way up to the heavier balls.\n\nAs with anything else that goes inside your body, you need to ensure that you take good care of your balls to keep them body safe.\n\nDon\u2019t use them without cleaning them! They can harbor bacteria if left uncleaned causing issues down the track.\n\nClean them before and after each use with a body safe antibacterial cleaner and warm water. They may gather dust and other floaties while they are not in use so you are better to be on the safe side.\n\nAs well as thoroughly cleaning the balls and storing them properly there are a few other things to keep in mind while they are in use. Make sure you urinate beforehand so you don\u2019t need to worry about needing to go and accidentally dropping a ball in.\n\nAnd, if you are exercising while you have them in, make sure that you don\u2019t do anything too vigorous. Be gentle and do what feels good for your body without overdoing it.\n\nNow that you know about what is out there, let\u2019s take a look at some of the best Kegel balls from each of these styles and what makes them so awesome.\n\nBest Kegel Balls\n\nBest Kegel Balls\n\nBest Kegel Balls\n\nBest Kegel Balls\n\nBest Kegel Balls\n\nHonestly, there is no real answer to this. As I stated earlier, these are a very personal product and it all comes down to what you need from your Kegel exercises. If you want feedback and help to stay on track, then the Elvie is perfect.\n\nYou want something natural with extra benefits for your bod? Try a Yoni Egg. And if you want interchangeable weights and extra stimulation while you wear them, go for duotone balls.\n\nAnd, if you want a set that is easy to use, with no fuss then the Kegel exercise kit might suit you best. Of course, if you are more experienced, then the gemstone Benwa balls might be perfect, but ultimately, what your body needs is up to you.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Get Luxurious With the Best Massage Oils For Couples\n\n\n\nAn oil massage can be a super sensational way to build intimacy. Massages encourage the body to release oxytocin, the hormone responsible for romantic bonding. They also help relieve stress and calm the nervous system, making massage one of the most generous gifts you can give.\n\nThere are tons of sensual massage oils out there to choose from, but finding out which is right for you and your partner takes a little consideration! In this article, we\u2019ll share the low down on our top 5 massage oils for couples.\n\nSome massage oils may include ingredients that are irritating or toxic, which you\u2019ll obviously want to avoid at all costs. Always check the ingredients before trying a product and be on the lookout for these features:\n\nFor the sexiest, most sensual experience possible, choose a massage oil that feels smooth and silky. Products that leave a tacky, greasy, or sticky residue can really gunk up a good time!\n\nEdibility\n\nSometimes our partners are so irresistibly delicious, it\u2019s impossible not to want a taste! Edible massage oils can be great if you like combining massage with oral sex, kissing, licking, and other slurpable types of sexual play.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite smells? Popular scents vary from lavender and lemongrass to rosemary and more. Be sure to ask your partner what kind of scents they\u2019d prefer as well. Some people are highly sensitive to strong smells, and they might want something subtle or entirely unscented.\n\nMassage oils that absorb into the skin quickly have to be reapplied often, which can get annoying after a bit (and expensive). Oils that absorb more slowly, last longer and stay slick. They\u2019re often easier to wash off too. On that note\u2026\n\nWashability\n\nSome massage oils have been known to stain sheets and clothes. Ideally, go for products that clearly state that they can be washed out of fabrics easily.\n\nCheaper massage oils average at around $10, while higher end oils can sell for $30, or even more. Generally, you get what you pay for, but it\u2019s not necessary to break the bank for a good experience.\n\nCan it double up as an intimate lubricant? If you\u2019re looking to move onto sex after the sensual massage, it can be handy to pick a product that can be used internally as well as externally. Vagina-friendly lube should be pH-balanced, sugar free, and compatible for use with your sex toys. Remember, any type of lube that contains silicone can\u2019t be used with silicone toys, as this will damage the toy. For anal play, you\u2019ll need something long lasting that doesn\u2019t need to be reapplied as often, as the anus is not self-lubricating.\n\nBest Massage Oils For Couples\n\nThis sensual massage oil is made from a combination of natural scents including lavender, almond and jojoba oil. It\u2019s silicone-free, paraben-free, preservative-free, and hypoallergenic. It also contains vitamin E, a supplement that helps repair damaged cells and is known to be good for the skin.\n\nThis product goes on smooth and is specifically formulated to not absorb into the skin too quickly, or too slowly. It won\u2019t leave behind a greasy or sticky texture. It\u2019s also ethically made to be cruelty free, meaning the oil is never tested on animals. And last but not least, it won\u2019t stain your clothes or sheets, so feel free to go nuts!\n\nBest Massage Oils For Couples\n\nFox Envy\u2019s sensual massage oil is made from all-natural coconut and jojoba oil. Its vanilla scent creates a nostalgic, cozy experience that will have you and your partner feeling deeply relaxed. In terms of body-friendliness, it\u2019s paraben-free and contains no harsh chemicals. It\u2019s also formulated to be easy on sensitive skin.\n\nFox Envy\u2019s oil is also easy and convenient for everyday use. The bottle comes with a pump rather than a cap, making it less messy to dispense.\n\nBest Massage Oils For Couples\n\nThis lemongrass-scented oil offers a fresher and more energizing experience than scents like vanilla and lavender. It\u2019s also free of parabens, sulfates, and preservatives, and is never tested on animals. This oil also washes off easily, if you\u2019d rather not have it on your skin for the rest of the day.\n\nBest Massage Oils For Couples\n\nThis product is made from a mix of organic oils, including jojoba oil, fractionated coconut oil, and sweet almond oil. Its enticing scent is a combination of lavender, geranium, and eucalyptus, which can provide an equally rich experience for both the giver and receiver during the massage. The ingredient list is GMO-free, non-toxic, and free of hexanes, parabens, artificial dyes, and artificial fragrances. It also contains Vitamin E and creates a lovely moisturizing effect.\n\nBest Massage Oils For Couples\n\nLooking for the most natural, frills-free option? Virgin coconut oil is hypoallergenic, unscented, paraben free, and preservative free. It doesn\u2019t get greasy or sticky during use and is great for moisturizing skin. For this reason, it\u2019s a popular oil choice for sensual massages.\n\nOpinions differ on whether using coconut oil as lube is truly safe. Some researchers say it increases the risk of vaginal infection, while others claim it may actually ward off infection. Some also claim coconut oil is pH-balanced and anti-bacterial, but these claims aren\u2019t currently supported by the science that\u2019s available.\n\nWhat we do know is that coconut oil can\u2019t be used with latex condoms or plastic sex toys, as it can break down those materials. Additionally, some people have an allergy to coconut, which could certainly spoil the mood. If you decide to use coconut oil as both massage oil and lube, you\u2019ll be entering well-charted territory, but taking a risk all the same.\n\nI would go with the Sensual Massage Oil by Maple Holistics, mainly because I have sensitive skin that\u2019s prone to icky reactions like breakouts and hives. The fact that it\u2019s hypoallergenic really appeals to me. I also adore the scent of lavender.\n\nHowever, you might prefer a different scent or formula of ingredients. Check out each option and try the one that appeals most to you.

{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>The Best Prostate Massager For Your Derriere Delights\n\n\n\nMove over, penis. It\u2019s time for the prostate to enjoy the spotlight.\n\nUpon first glance, the prostate doesn\u2019t seem that exciting. It\u2019s just a walnut-sized gland that sits between the bladder and the penis, right?\n\nIts daily biological tasks include mundane items like producing seminal fluid and nourishing sperm. So what?\n\nBut did you know that it can also provide earth-shattering orgasms?\n\nAccessible via the anus and rectum in people assigned male at birth, one of the best ways to give or experience a prostate orgasm is with a specially designed toy. Shaped and engineered to maximize your pleasure, they also help to provide many health benefits that come along with prostate massage.\n\nSo here are the 5 best prostate massagers and everything you need to know to get started with prostate play.\n\nIn our heteronormative society, straight men, especially, can be a little uptight about butt-stuff. But here are just a few reasons this special brand of sex play is becoming more and more popular amongst everyone with a prostate.\n\nFor starters, the pleasure is out of this world. Imagine a body-rocking orgasm that you feel head to toe \u2014 and now imagine that sensation lasting way longer than a standard orgasm.\n\nBetter yet, many people report a shorter refractory period with prostate orgasms, meaning you can have them more frequently and get back into action faster. And who doesn\u2019t want more pleasure, faster?\n\nNot only that, but there are proven health benefits to regular prostate massage and prostate induced orgasms.\n\nStudies show that giving sensual attention to this overlooked area of your body can reduce symptoms of erectile dysfunction, help with urine blockages, and can even alleviate painful ejaculation from prostatitis.\n\nTo reap the pleasure and health benefits of a prostate orgasm, you can use your finger or a toy (usually called a prostate massager or prostate stimulator) to stimulate the walnut-sized gland. Toys are preferable for most people since they\u2019re more hygenic when cleaned properly. Plus they minimize the risk of nasty cuts from fingernails, and are specifically shaped for maximum pleasure.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at how to buy the best prostate vibrator and the key features you should consider.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to all of this, choosing the best prostate dildo or vibrator can be pretty overwhelming.\n\nHowever, your choice gets a lot easier once you zero in on a few key features.\n\nA majority of massager models will have a small, removable vibrating bullet that creates waves or pulses throughout the device.\n\nThe upside here is increased sensation and a lot more control over the specific pattern and intensity of the vibration. Not to mention, vibrations can increase blood flow and sensitivity to the area, which can feel amazing for some people.\n\nOn the other hand, you can choose a manual or non-vibrating prostate massager if you prefer 100% control over the sensation.\n\nThis ultimately boils down to a personal preference, and many vibrating models will work just fine if you want to start off with the bullet removed or the vibration turned off.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing to look for in a prostate massager is its length and girth.\n\nBeginner users will want something a little bit slimmer and easier to insert, while people who are experienced with prostate play may want to take things up a notch for a more \u201cfuller\u201d feeling.\n\nA 1 inch diameter is about average for these devices. Go thinner or thicker depending on your experience level and preferences.\n\nThe handle on your prostate vibrator won\u2019t (usually) make a big difference in how your orgasm feels, but it can make the device a lot easier to use and more comfortable.\n\nRound handles like you might find on a traditional vibrator are great for partner play, since it\u2019s easy for a partner to grip. But if you\u2019re exploring by yourself, you might need something more ergonomic with a grip that\u2019s comfortable for you.\n\nRegardless of what kind of grip you wind up choosing, it\u2019s critical that your massager has a flared base. Otherwise the risk of it going \u201cmissing\u201d in your butt is pretty high \u2013 and the last thing you want is an awkward trip to A&E.\n\nYou might also consider hands-free options where the vibrations can be controlled with a remote, or even an app on your phone or other smart device \u2014 this can really take your solo or partnered sessions to the next level!\n\nAnd finally, some vibrator handles feature knobs or bulbs to stimulate your perineum for a little extra external pleasure.\n\nIf it\u2019s a prostate orgasm you\u2019re after, you\u2019re better off buying a toy specifically designed for the job and not just a standard vibrator.\n\nThe difference mostly comes down to the shape of the toys.\n\nProstate massagers are curved to fit perfectly into the anus and properly reach the prostate. Vibrators require a different curvature to fit inside the vagina and stimulate the G-spot.\n\nGetting the most out of your new toy will take practice and a lot of self-exploration, but there are a few things you should keep in mind if you\u2019re just getting started with prostate orgasms.\n\nBefore you do anything, everything should be clean!\n\nEveryone involved should wash their hands thoroughly, and make sure your vibrator or dildo has been thoroughly cleaned and dried. A mild soap and warm water is usually enough for most toys.\n\nAs for your butt itself, gently douching your anus is a good idea to get rid of any fecal matter before you dive right in.\n\nThe importance of lubrication cannot be overstated for anal play! There are tons of different kinds of lube to choose from, but water or silicone-based lubricants are usually best.\n\nCoconut oil, and other oil-based lubes, work well and can double as a sensual massage oil! But be careful \u2014 avoid oil-based lubricants if you plan on using condoms or any latex during your session. The oil can erode the latex\u2026 and no one wants that!\n\nAgain, there\u2019s no one right way to massage your prostate, but here\u2019s a general guide if this will be your first time:\n\nHygiene is just as important after anal play as it is before. No getting lazy and tossing the vibrator on the bathroom counter to deal with later. When fecal matter is involved, you\u2019ll need to clean your hands and all toys thoroughly and immediately. Again, warm water and a mild soap work great in most cases.\n\nProstate Massager\n\nSleek, beautiful, and exceptionally good at its job, the Lelo Loki is one of the best prostate massagers.\n\nIts shape and round handle make it perfect for use with a partner, while it\u2019s ease of operation and ergonomics mean you\u2019ll love using it along, too.\n\nIt\u2019s thick enough to give you that nice, full feeling at just under 1.5 inches in diameter, but approachable enough for beginners. It\u2019s also extremely versatile and is just as effective with the vibrations turned off.\n\nProstate Massager\n\nAneros is one of the most trusted names in the sex toy industry, and the Helix Trident is an awesome non-vibrating starter toy for those just getting into prostate play.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry \u2014 it has enough versatility for veteran users, too!\n\nThe well-contoured handle is great for solo or partner play (plus a little extra perineum stimulation), and its manageable girth (about 1 inch in diameter) is great for almost everyone.\n\nWarning: This is a manual toy with no vibration, but even so, its bulbous head can be a little too much stimulation for some users.\n\nProstate Massager\n\nOne look at this thing and you can see why they call it the Big Boy!\n\nIf you need something that packs a little more power, you might enjoy the thickness and girth of this device from Rocks off. Its 5-inch circumference is about 1.5 times thicker than the average vibrator!\n\nThis guy brings it with the vibrations, as well, featuring 7 whole different functions compared to the 3-5 you\u2019ll find in many other models.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to butt play, however, you might find the thickness of the Rocks Off Big Boy to be a little too much to handle and it might not be the best prostate massager.\n\nProstate Massager\n\nWant to break out the big guns and experience intense, body-shaking orgasms?\n\nThe Aneros Vice 2 might just be your ticket to pleasure town and the best prostate massager for that. Its claim to fame is the remote control for hands-free use and a ridiculous number of vibration settings to play with.\n\nThat makes it perfect for a night alone, or pair it during penetration for some mind-blowing sex.\n\nThis vibrator is more advanced, however, and will take some practice to master.\n\nProstate Massager\n\nPart sex toy, part conversation piece! (OK, not really, but it sure is pretty to look at.)\n\nThe Njoy Pure Fun is one of the sleekest, classiest prostate toys around with its stainless steel design.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all about the looks. Its unique material means it can be warmed or chilled to your liking for a little extra sensation. Just place it in the fridge or soak it in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes \u2014 the metal is excellent at retaining just the right temperature afterwards.\n\nThe unique handle is great for both solo and partner play.\n\nThe only downside of this one is that it can become extremely slippery when lubricated.\n\nWe\u2019ll be honest with you, there\u2019s no single \u201cbest prostate massager\u201d on the market.\n\nMost of the options from reputable brands are excellent choices, so it\u2019s really down to you to figure out which features are most important to you.\n\nThat will take some exploration and learning. You\u2019ll need to experiment with yourself, a partner, and/or different devices \u2014 especially if you\u2019re a total beginner when it comes to prostate play.\n\nFor our money though, you can\u2019t go wrong with the Lelo Loki. It features a simple design and is easy enough for most people to learn to use, and is powerful enough for beginner and advanced users.\n\nAt an approachable price point, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to do much better.<|endoftext|>"}

Try This Bio Resonance Meditation\n\n\n\nWould you like to experience a more intimate connection with your partner?\nAre you up for something new?\n\nIf you read some of our articles about Tantra, breast massages or the Yoni Massage, you\u2019re quite beducated already!\n\nBut this is just the beginning, the very first bite of a delicious meal that is served right in front of you. There is so much more to explore. To give you some inspiration and widen your horizon a little more, we\u2019d like to share the following meditation with you.\n\nTantra Master Ma Ananda Sarita studied Tantra with Osho for more than 25 years and learned many beautiful techniques. One of those is the Bio-Resonance Meditation that we love to share with you.\n\nIt helps you to sync your vibe with your partner\u2019s one, brings harmony to the male-female dynamic (we could all use a little more of that, don\u2019t we?) and deepens intimacy.\n\nNote: You can try this meditation with your partner or a friend and simply adopt the positions to what feels right for you. It might sound a bit woo-woo at first, so take it as an experiment, take it easy and dare to try something different.\n\nThere is always something to experience that you never thought of before.\n\nPrepare a space for your meditation practice. Light some candles, make sure to not be disturbed by others or your phone \u2013 or important appointments before or after it. It\u2019s easier to tune in if the mind feels like being \u201callowed\u201d to relax. Set the time and space for your needs and preferences.\n\n(10 minutes) Sit opposite your partner, with your palms touching and fingers resting lightly on your partner\u2019s wrists. With your eyes closed, and breathing normally, simply witness your breathing, your mind, and your emotions as an impartial observer.\n\nThis position automatically creates harmony in the bio-electricity within your own body, and between you and your partner.\n\n(3 minutes) Simultaneously, together, place the middle finger of your right hand on your partner\u2019s heart chakra, in the center of the chest. This creates a heart resonance between you.\n\n(3 minutes) Simultaneously, each of you, place the middle finger of your right hand on your partner\u2019s third eye center, between the eyebrows. This will create a resonance in your intuition.\n\n(10 minutes) \u00a0With your palms touching and fingers resting lightly on your partner\u2019s wrists, create a resonance of the voice by humming together. Humming activates the crown chakra and the central channel, bringing an awakening of spiritual energy.\n\n(10 minutes) Take turns to touch the whole of your partner\u2019s body, wherever you can reach. The touch is loving and firm, anchoring the resonance in the physical body. Then caress your partner\u2019s aura with your hands, around the physical body. The receiving partner sits with eyes closed and in silence throughout.\n\n(10 minutes) You can both have your eyes open or closed at this stage. Either remain seated opposite each other or move into the Yab Yum position, with the Lingam (=penis) inside the Yoni (=vagina) or not as you wish.\n\nIf the Lingam is inside the Yoni, you are not moving towards genital release, but simply relaxing together in the state called \u201cplugging in\u201d.\n\nNow enter into a phase of circular breathing.\n\nFor the first 5 minutes, the man breathes out through his Lingam. As he does so, the woman inhales the breath through her Yoni, raises the breath upward, and breathes out through her heart.\n\nAs she does so, the man breathes in through his heart, allows the breath to descend, and breathes out through his Lingam, and so on. If you wish, one of you can show the breathing circle through hand gestures.\n\nFor the next 5 minutes, reverse the breathing circle. The woman breathes out through her Yoni as the man breathes in through his Lingam. He raises the breath and then breathes out through his heart. As he does so, the woman breathes in through her heart, allows the breath to descend, and then breathes out through her Yoni, and so on.\n\nThis phase activates the main positive poles in both partners and also helps to awaken their inner male and inner female aspects so that the experience of transformation through Tantra can flower.\n\nLook into each other\u2019s eyes, and then bow down, crown chakras touching, to express your gratitude for this shared meditation. Notice how your body now feels after the meditation and take a while in silence to enjoy this relaxed state with your partner.\n\nHow do you see your partner now? What changed between you? Is there something new?\n\nShare your experience with each other and be grateful for this new experience together.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to learn more about how to merge sexuality, love and spirituality with Tantra Master Sarita in her upcoming Masterclass: Sign up here!<|endoftext|>"}

Does he want to finish in my mouth? Eesh\u2026 What should I do with the balls?!\u201d\u201d\n\nDid you ever weigh the pros and cons of giving a blowjob? If so, we have something you can add to the pros side of the list.\u00a0 Apparently, oral sex is directly linked to a person\u2019s perception of how good their relationship is. According to a study conducted by US researchers, we think that our relationships are better if we regularly receive oral sex. And it looks like that this is especially true for men. So how come blowjobs are so important? We took a deep dive into it to see what\u2019s the deal here.\n\nThis survey shows that 85% of men consider blowjobs an essential part of naughty frolicking. In fact, many (66%) wouldn\u2019t mind if their partner was only a pro when it comes to blowjobs, they\u2019d stick around for the fun. If your penis-owning partner is into blowies, not going down on them might put a damper on your relationship. However, if your mouth knows its way around a cock, it can give your overall connection a delicious boost.\n\nBlowjobs might determine how good our relationship is. We know how this sounds, but hear us out. The pleasure received through oral sex may boost the chance of orgasm and enhance sexual enjoyment. Makes sense so far, right? Well, this is where the relationship part comes in. As partners, we often consider sexual happiness a crucial part of our romantic relationships.\n\nWe often judge how good the situation with our partner is depending on the mood in the bedroom. If everything\u2019s going smoothly between the sheets, we take it as a sign of a healthy relationship, right? If we\u2019re experiencing hiccups, then it ripples through the rest of our interactions. So, if there is a steady stream of the mouth-on-cock type of fun, your penis-owning partner probably thinks you are a match made in heaven.\n\nLook, this might sound like it\u2019s far-fetched but it really isn\u2019t. Research shows that relationship satisfaction is a big contributor to a person\u2019s psychological well-being. If your relationship is smooth-sailing, everything else is at least a little more bearable, too. So, if blowjobs are important for sexual happiness, and sexual happiness is important for overall peace of mind\u2026 You already see the pattern here.\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of closeness when it comes to blowjobs. You\u2019re down there, face to face with your partner\u2019s excitement. It doesn\u2019t get much more intimate than that. The truth is that many men feel their own inhibitions about their members and oral sex. Some men might be insecure about their size or how their dick looks like (which they totally shouldn\u2019t be!). Then there\u2019s performance anxiety and worries about their taste.\n\nWhat we mean is that going down on your man can be an act of acceptance.\n\nIt\u2019s a way to express that you love him the way he is. For the receiver, blowjobs can be a way to show trust. They trust the giver to see them in all their glory and without judgment. No wonder that getting head from a partner is much more fun if you are in a committed relationship.\n\nSexual satisfaction reduces stress levels.\n\nThe more and the better the sex you have, the more joyful your everyday life is. It positively impacts the quality of life and your health. While this is not exclusive to blowjobs, oral sex can increase sexual fulfillment if your partner enjoys getting head. It can also be a great way to diversify your fun in the bedroom which is crucial when kindling your relationship sparks.\n\nSo the receiver feels happy and less stressed. But what\u2019s in it for the giver? Some say it\u2019s\u00a0health benefits. This has circulated the world wide web a few years ago, but it still has not been fully proven. So far, one study has shown that swallowing cum is linked to a lower risk of getting dangerously high blood pressure.\n\nCum also has zinc, calcium, potassium, and other goodies in it such as mood-boosting endorphins, oxytocin, and serotonin. And these happy fellas act as antidepressants when absorbed through vaginal tissue. Science still needs to work on it when it comes to oral sex. But this already sounds promising!\n\nWe don\u2019t know about you, but we think these are some very strong pro-blowjob arguments. Going down on your man can:\n\nSo next time you\u2019re in the spirit of giving \u2013 give head!<|endoftext|>"}

Really.\n\nBig or small, hanging or standing, caged in a bra or dancing freely, your boobs are always with you. They are the perfect combination between sexy and functional. Instead of neglecting their presence, let\u2019s celebrate your girls and give them a massage they will never forget.\n\nAnd you can be sure\u2026\nThey will give you some favors in return!\n\nWe promise: You will feel and see the benefits of your breast massage.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the most important one.\n\nBreasts come in such a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors, and they are a great starting point for women to love our bodies. \u2013 Sofia Sundari\n\nThere are rumors that 90 percent of women worry about the size of their breasts and others cry over the shape. We need to tackle this issue! Our breast, especially the nipples are the first thing which enters a room. If we feel comfortable with them, we will feel comfortable with the rest that follows. ?\n\nYou may be uncomfortable at first with touching your breasts, yet believe us, it doesn\u2019t take long for you to get into this practice.\u00a0And the result of the simple practice I will show you soon is a pleasant feeling of \u201chey, I am beautiful.\u201d\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t we want to radiate this, when we enter the room? ?\n\nMariah dives deeper in the benefits of\u00a0Falling in Love With Your Breasts.\n\n\u201cThere are many benefits of regular breast massage, including firmer breasts and balanced hormones, which contributes to enhanced overall breast health.\u201d \u2013 Peruquois\n\nThere are two hormones which show up and spread their gifts when massaging your breast: Prolactin and Oxytocin.\n\nProlactin is a protein that is best known for its role in enabling mammals, to produce milk. When a woman is pregnant, prolactin levels increase by up to 10-20 times the average amount.\n\nDespite what its name suggests, prolactin does much more than only promote lactation. It is found in men as well and is influential in over 300 separate processes.\n\nProlactin is necessary for water/salt regulation, metabolism, reproductive behavior, the immune system, hormones, and the brain.\n\nAnd it makes your boobs firmer and bigger.\u00a0?\n\nAn increase in prolactin cause enlargement of the mammary glands (usually to prepare for milk production).\n\nNot bad, right? It\u2019s getting better.\n\nThere are some fun ways to increase Prolactin:\n\nWe can manage this \ud83d\ude09\n\nBut Oxytocin is even greater.\n\nOxytocin is like glue.\n\nLook.\n\nYou know the warm, soft feeling when you lie in the arms of your lover?\nThis feeling is connected with Oxytocin. After great sex, you could cuddle the whole world. You feel relaxed and calm, somehow protected and it feels natural to trust strangers.\n\nScience backs this up!\n\nA lack of oxytocin results in a loss of social interest. However, giving oxytocin to people increases trust and generosity. It reduces the fear of social betrayal in humans.\n\nAnd\u2026 it makes you leaner.\n\nRecent evidence has suggested that oxytocin may play a vital role in suppressing appetite under normal conditions.\n\nOnce again sex and sexual stimulation spike up your Oxytocin level. So do yourself a favor and massage your breast.?\n\nBefore I show you a simple Step by Step guide, a short note about oil.\n\nWhich oil for breast massage fits, is not a tough question. First, you need to feel comfortable. We love coconut oil. It is not too thick and not too greasy.\n\nYou can buy virgin coconut oil everywhere. It doesn\u2019t have to be extra massage oil. Just take the one you use for cooking (rule of thumb: what\u2019s good for the inside is also good for the outside).\n\nAn additional tip. Heat it up! Just take a bowl, fill hot water in it and put your coconut-glass inside it. Now the coconut oil melts, and you have a warm, nice smelling massage oil. Perfect!\n\nAlternatives are evening primrose oil or cocoa butter.\n\nHe lifts her breasts, which fit perfectly into his hands, though he knows this is no promise that he gets to keep them [\u2026]. \u2015Barbara Kingsolver excerpt from Pigs in Heaven\n\nBut you can. And it\u2019s time for the action part.\n\nBefore we start, don\u2019t forget: Your breasts are your primal centers of feelings, emotions, nourishment, and love. The yogis would even say: \u201cBreasts are the extension of your heart.\u201d Touch them gently and when your partner gives you a breast massage guide him/her.\n\nIn the next steps, we are sharing with you an exclusive\u00a0insight on how our  expert Sofia Sundari teaches the breast massage technique to her students in the Yoni Yoga Course.\n\n1. Distribute the warm oil all over your chest.\n\n2. Start massaging your collar bone\u00a0and the chest in tiny circles with the tip of your fingers. You can also tap on it\u00a0as if cleansing rain is coming down your chest. You may feel some pressure at the beginning because the chest stores toxins, so don\u2019t be alarmed.\n\n3. Place the center of your palm on your nipple directly barely touching, let the chi of your healing hands penetrate your breast. Hold that for a few moments. Breathe deeply into your heart.\n\n4. Squeeze them a little with your palms on your nipples. Then move your right hand clockwise, while your left-hand moves counter-clockwise. Your fingertips meet in the middle. Do this for a few seconds.\n\n5. Now move to the side of your breasts (your nibbles are free now ;)).\n\nDo this for a couple of rounds and then change the direction.\u00a0To finalize, squeeze them a little in freestyle and shake them out. ?\u00a0Let them dance! Hold them again and thank yourself for giving your breasts love and relaxation.\n\nStep 1 to 5 is a simple routine you can easily implement in your day. You would be surprised how relaxing this little routine is. But here are a few additional movements that spice things up.\n\nSlide your index and middle finger from the outside towards the center of your breast.\u00a0Then do the same thing from above, other side and below, always gliding towards the nipple. Then do the same with the other breast.\n\nMove your index fingers and middle finger from the side of your nipples in a spiral movement around your breasts towards the outside. Stop for a moment and move back towards the nipples.\n\nPlace the center of your palms on your nipples. The tips of your fingers are in the air, only the center of your palm is touching the nipples lightly. Keep the hands in a relaxed state. Stay here for a moment and feel the Chi connection.\u00a0Start moving your palms in very tiny circles. Make a few rounds and then switch directions. This\u00a0massage is a very mindful practice.\n\nPlace one hand underneath your breasts to stabilize. Slide with the contrary from the top down. Repeat five times and switch to the other breast.\n\nThen place one hand 5 cm above your nipples and move with the opposite hand from bottom up. Then switch to the other breast again.\n\nIf you liked this guide, you should check out our brand-new masterclass with Tantra teacher Sofia Sundari on how to train your Yoni for aliveness with the help of the Yoni Egg!

Ouch?\n\nFor some people, deep cervix penetration can be an uncomfortable experience, that is, if they\u2019re not properly aroused, or aware of some particularly important information around cervix penetration; such as where exactly is the cervix? What does hitting the cervix feel like? How far is the cervix from the G-spot? And can you go too deep?\n\nUgh, but when you are aroused and educated \u2026 how deliciously pleasurable deeper cervix penetration can be. Didn\u2019t we tell you knowledge is sexy?\n\nFirst of all, I have news for ya \u2013 cervix penetration is not actually possible.\n\nAt least not during full penetration with a penis or dildo. The cervix has a really tiny hole called the os, made only for those pesky sperm to pass through (ah except during childbirth \u2013 but that\u2019s another story).\n\nOver the course of the menstrual cycle, the cervix changes position. Some people\u00a0track\u00a0their fertility by feeling their cervix with their fingers. This position and texture can have an effect on the depth and sensation. For example, during and just after a period the cervix is typically low and hard. Yet nearing ovulation, it becomes higher and softer.\n\nDuring arousal, the cervix often lifts and the vaginal canal elongates. It\u2019s also important to note that\u00a0vaginal depth\u00a0varies from person to person. For cis women, the average depth is 3.5-5 inches, whereas for post-op trans women, it can range from 5-6.5 inches.\n\nSo what are you actually experiencing during deep penetration if it\u2019s not cervix penetration? Well, it\u2019s really just stimulation of the cervical base. This\u00a0study\u00a0found that a distinct orgasm is possible from cervical stimulation with a penis. As the cervix is connected to the vagus nerve, an orgasmic pathway can even be\u00a0activated\u00a0in people with spinal cord injuries.\n\nRead our in depth article on\u00a0cervical orgasms here.\n\nThis\u00a0study\u00a0looked into the possibility of an evolutionary theory for liking longer penises in relation to cervical pleasure. However, the results came back insufficient.\n\nMeaning that, no, a longer penis isn\u2019t biologically determined to provide deeper pleasure.\n\nIf you are also worried that deeper penetration will dislodge your IUD, remember, the cervix is not being penetrated, so it\u2019s very unlikely. To check, you or your partner may feel the strings hanging out of the cervix opening \u2013 but if you\u2019re concerned, visit your sexual health doctor.\n\nWhat you really want to make sure before you explore deeper penetration, is to be prepared. Take things slow and build up that delicious arousal.\n\nPain could be a response from your body saying \u201cI\u2019m just not ready for this!\u201d\n\nSome typical causes for\u00a0abdominal pain after sex\u00a0can range from certain sex positions or pelvic floor problems. At different times of the month, the position of the cervix may affect how much depth you can handle. If you notice blood after deep penetration, this might be due to lack of lubrication and internal friction.\n\nBut just a quick reminder, we\u2019d strongly recommend going to see your doctor if your pain problems persist, and especially if you experience bleeding after deep penetration.\n\nPerhaps, like me, you\u2019ve had some partners who\u2019ve just pounded or poked you too hard. This, and other traumas, can leave you with the memory of it being painful, or subsequently numb, with your nervous system dissociating from this area.\n\nHere\u2019s some great tips for\u00a0turning pain during sex into pleasure.\n\nHere\u2019s some pointers to prepare you for some sensationally deeper pleasure.\n\nWe cannot stress this hard enough. Even though the vagina is naturally lubricating, some people dry out quicker than others. Adding lube can only make for a more sensual ride. Here\u2019s some of our\u00a0best lubes recommendations for masturbation.\n\nWorried that the penis is too long? Try out the\u00a0Ohnut\u00a0intimate wearable. They are comfy modular rings you place on the base of the penis, designed to control the depth of penetration.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re worried it\u2019s too short? Wait till you\u2019ve checked out our sex positions for max penetration below \u2013 sometimes all you need is a pillow prop. Alternatively, if the penis isn\u2019t fulfilling your deepest desires (particularly at certain times of the month) \u2013 invest in a penis extender, strap on, or dildo\u2026\n\nFind a length that suits you. If you take the time to measure your vagina this might help! One way to do that is squat down and insert your fingers or even a cooking spoon with a condom on it. Either use your knuckle or part of the spoon as a point of measurement to find the length that feels good for you.\n\nIdeally you want to use medically-safe\u00a0organic dildos\u00a0that are healthy and eco-friendly. Make sure it has a good handle, or find a suction dildo for a hands-free ride into the night.\n\nGoing back to basics? If you are thinking of using your hands, minimise scratching at all costs and make sure your fingernails are trimmed and filed. Or invest in latex gloves. Just remember, relax, go at your own pace, and back off if it\u2019s too intense or painful.\n\nAlso know that it\u2019s totally fine if that doesn\u2019t work. Not all women are able to touch their cervix with fingers. For some, the vaginal canal is longer than their fingers.\n\nLie on your back, knees tucked in toward your chest. Reach around behind your legs with your fingers or dildo to penetrate deeply. Rock forward and back, side to side to add a rhythm to it. Place a cushion or two under your lower back for more depth.\n\nGet on all fours, reach between your legs with your dildo. Explore arching and rounding your back to hit the deeper spots. Like in yoga, use your breath to feel deeply into this position.\n\nGot yourself a suction dildo? Stick it on the floor or wall and bounce on it. Go at it like a rabbit!\n\nIn this cervix penetration position, lie with your belly flat on the bed with your legs zipped closed. Lying on top of you, your partner can penetrate you lifting themselves up.\n\nThis modified doggy position will have you howling! Get on all fours at the edge of the bed, but with pillows under your knees raising your ass in the air. Your partner standing beside the bed penetrating you from behind.\n\nDive into a deep state of pleasure in this turtle position. Just like puppy pose in yoga, get on your knees with your forearms spread forward and your chest close to the floor or bed beneath you. Have your partner penetrate you from behind with their penis or strap-on.\n\nLying on your back with your legs in the air, have your partner penetrate you deeply. Hungry for more, wrap your legs around their head and pull them in closer\u2026\n\nTake charge in this position. Where the other sex positions for max penetration your partner is mostly in control, the cow queen is a royal step up from the cow girl where you command how much depth you like. Sit on your throne and ride it, moving your hips back and forth.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth trying out different motions. Varying speed, faster and slower thrusts, shallow and deeper penetrations, and gyrating by circling the hips to hit different points.\n\nAnd never, ever underestimate the power of a pillow! Minor adjustments to the positions, such as placing a cushion under your bum during missionary can make all the difference.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough for you, we\u2019d recommend reading up on our\u00a0tantric practices, and learn how to spread your orgasmic energy through the body with deep breathing. Strengthen the vagina with\u00a0kegel exercises\u00a0for stronger orgasms.\n\nCervix penetration might not be for you at all \u2013 and that\u2019s okay!\n\nGo at your own pace and learn your boundaries. Most importantly, remember to enjoy the pleasure journey. Keep it playful and listen to your body.<|endoftext|>"}

Until they were not.\n\nSuddenly the smell of synthetic plastic and the thought of sticking toxins up my lady bits became a total turn-off. Aside from that, my generic fleshy dildos provided superficial pleasure. In other words, I achieved an orgasm but I was left craving more. Then my vagina met a crystal dildo. And from that moment on, everything changed.\n\nCrystal dildos are like Alice and Wonderland meets the adult porn industry.\n\nTotally magical, kinky, playful and awesome. Furthermore, crystal dildos are body-safe and made of organic stones from all over the earth.\n\nThe best part about crystal dildos?

As a teenager, we probably weren\u2019t thinking about how they could amplify our sex life.\n\nToday, crystals have matured into the world of adult toys.\n\nAnd, if used correctly, crystal dildos can help one awaken their sensuality & enhance their pelvic floor health.\n\nSaying that, it\u2019s important to note that the power of crystal dildos works for some and not for others.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at who would benefit from this product, and who would probably be better settling for a more generic dildo.\n\nCrystal dildos are for people who are interested in pleasure as well as nourishment and inner healing.\n\nMany first time users explain that crystal dildos are the real deal and that they are powerful beyond physical sensation.\n\nWith that said, a crystal dildo is probably not ideal for someone looking for a quickie. That is to say, a crystal dildo is not just a toy, or for people looking for a \u201csuperficial\u201d physical experience.\n\nThe point is that if you are merely seeking physical pleasure you may not want to introduce crystal dildos to your lady bits just yet.\n\nA great alternative is this fleshy and flexible 7.5-inch dildo with suction cup base for hands-free pleasure.\n\nHowever, if you are the kind of person who is craving a little spicy energy boost in your hoo-hoo, then read on.\n\nIf used in an intentional way, crystal pleasure wands strive to take you to new realms of self-indulgence.\n\nKeeping this in mind, we are totally enamored in particular with the Rose Quartz Wand. Why?\n\nNot only is this crystal dildo beautifully crafted but it also works to connect us with the most divine, sensual and feminine essence within.\n\nAll wands are organically sourced from the earth, so whichever stone you choose, you can try to coordinate with its specific property.\n\nBut be mindful, and remember that not all dildo-shaped crystals are made for internal use. With this in mind consider the following pros and cons of crystal dildo play:\n\nOne of the reasons we love pleasure wands so much is because they are stunningly beautiful. I mean you could put these crystal dildos on display in your house and convince visitors it\u2019s part of your home decor.\n\nSeriously though, each pleasure wand is a lovingly crafted work of art. Besides that, most wands are thick enough for your fine fanny. They are approximately 18cm long and 4cm thick (a sizeable phallic shaped wand) and measure at about 500g in weight.\n\nKeep in mind, that since all stones come from mother earth, the wands may be cold to touch at first. You can easily warm it up beforehand with a little friction from your hands. You can also run it under warm water.\n\nAs mentioned above, we absolutely love the Rose Quartz Wand, as it opens your heart to experience more love.\n\nStruggling with low self-esteem? The Rose Quartz Wand can also teach you how to love yourself. It can also help you accept love from others.\n\nAnother one of our chosen favorites is the: The Indian Jade Pleasure Wand which can help us to quiet the monkey mind inside of us.\n\nWhen all said and done, diving into the world of crystal dildos can be a bit intimidating. Unlike your fleshy dildo you have stowed away in your sock drawer, crystal dildos are not malleable, and will take some time getting used to.\n\nA great way to get started is to check out: How to use the ROSE QUARTZ PLEASURE WAND with Rosie Rees.\n\nEach wand will vary in size and shape, but there are a few wands that can dig even deeper into your most intimate nooks and crannies.\n\nCervical stimulators, for example, have a unique curved shape and bulbous end that can help women access more sensation in their cervix. Curved dildos can also help promote female ejaculation (aka squirting).\n\nFor anal play, you can experiment with wands that have bulbs like this one.\n\nIf the thick phallic shape of pleasure wands feel overwhelming \u2013 you can try this one, appropriately named the virgin. The virgin is great if you are on the petite side, or struggle with an overactive pelvic floor.\n\nStill not totally convinced that pleasure wands are something you want to get into? Looking for some real-people reviews on the subject?\n\nCheck what other people are saying about pleasure wands on Instagram:\n\n@j\u2026: \u201cI can totally relate to this. I used the Rose Quartz wand a few times and then one night I just laid there and sobbed for a good 15 minutes. It was what I needed it was healing me and my body telling me to realise that pleasure comes with a healing process. It was beautiful after the sobbing stopped I couldn\u2019t stop hugging myself and smiling and loving myself wholeheartedly. It was beautiful.\u201d\n\n@j\u2026: \u201cYou must be open and ready to embrace or journey to another level of ur sexuality. I see it as mother nature giving me one of its many gifts to heal n pleasure my inner goddess.\u201d\n\nNot into crystals? But still itching to find a great alternative for your privy parts?\n\nWell, lucky for you, there are some really good alternatives out there and most of them are body safe and made from more natural and less-stinky synthetic materials.\n\nDidn\u2019t find an alternative that suits your fanny? You can read more about other alternatives here.\n\nIf you are looking for deep pleasure, a higher level of consciousness and increased sexual vitality, crystal pleasure wands are for you.\n\nThe best part about these pleasure wands is that they may help you release old ideas you have about sex, and turn you into a pleasure vixen. Moreover, pleasure wands can allow you to trust your own pleasure-based instincts, guilt, and shame FREE!\n\nAs with any crystal, make sure you set your intention before play. If you set your intention right, then get ready.\n\nCrystal dildos will groom you for the most magical and sensual ride of your life.<|endoftext|>"}

Are you in this for God, or are you in this to gratify your ego?\u201d\n\nAt that moment, it dawned on Carina that James was, in fact, an asshole.\n\nSpiritual values are an amazing contribution to a relationship.\n\nUnconditional love. Mutual evolution. Witnessing consciousness and holding space. Seeing the Divine in another human being. Having someone see us as Divine.\n\nUnfortunately, the ego can pick up on the spiritual terminology (without grasping the underlying concepts), and use spiritual language for egoic purposes.\n\nIn James\u2019 case, the spiritual language allowed him to control the relationship, stay in his comfort zone, and to avoid looking at his own contribution to Carina\u2019s stress and unhappiness.\n\nSpiritual egotists have often picked up a range of useful relationship skills.\n\nThese can range from sexual techniques and hacks, using flowers, candles, and incense to turn lovemaking into an erotic ritual, active listening skills, and the ability to remain steady and present in the face of strong emotion.\n\nAll these skills can make the wrong people, very attractive prospective partners.\n\nThe defensive use of spiritual words to avoid deep\u00a0genuine connection only shows up gradually over time, often over months, or even years.\n\nAnd, because there is a small element of truth in the spiritual asshole\u2019s argument (if we were, in fact, completely detached, their behaviour wouldn\u2019t actually upset us, after all), we focus on ourselves and our own weaknesses, rather than asserting our boundaries and our right to equal consideration in the relationship.\n\nIronically, if we were, in fact, completely detached, we would be willing to say \u201cIf you can\u2019t keep your appointments with me, I am not willing to spend time with you.\u201d\n\nIt is our attachment that keeps us playing the spiritual asshole\u2019s game.\n\nNow, I want to be fair here\u2026\n\nAsshole is a strong word, and I am using it for emphasis. Most spiritual assholes don\u2019t realize they are assholes.\n\nThey just think of themselves as spiritual.\n\nMost spiritual assholes are simply coping with their own childhood wounds in ways that make perfect sense to them, and they think that the world would be a better place if everyone else used the same coping strategies that they use.\n\nThe world is full of spiritual assholes, but it is also full of brave, generous, spiritual warriors, who will stand in the fire with you and not look back. Exercise discrimination, and you can have a true spiritual partnership.<|endoftext|>"}

Practise xxuality for greater passion, fulfilment, and joy.\n\nAs many of you know, we held the Conscious Sexuality Summit in September 2016. And we thought it might be a tremendous idea to share the main takeaways and practices with you in the form of this article.\n\nSo no matter whether you participated in the summit \u2013 or just stumbled about this post \u2013 I\u2019m sure it will be incredibly helpful.\n\nSpeaker: Marc Steinberg\nTalk: Awakening Kundalini Energy Through Love-Making\n\n\u201cOrgasmic energy is ultimately Kundalini energy.\u201d\n\nMarc Steinberg explains the principles of awakening your Kundalini Energy. This mysterious energy is capable of creating various states of bliss, up to states of enlightenment.\n\nIn preparation, you must work through your emotional and mental barriers. Before awakening your Kundalini, you need to tackle your shame, guilt, fear, as well as other shadows. This ensures that a rising Kundalini doesn\u2019t have negative effects.\n\nDuring love-making, you can use breathing techniques for awakening the Kundalini. Oxygen is the O in Orgasm and orgasmic energy is ultimately Kundalini Energy.\n\nLearn the precise techniques Marc is teaching by purchasing the Summit Package.\n\nSpeaker: Jennifer Russell\nTalk: Using Archetypes for Sexual Empowerment\n\n\u201cWe are one of many infinite perspectives of all that is.\u201d\n\nJennifer Russell introduces the profound power of subconscious archetypes.\n\nWe are all moved by archetypes in our emotional lives, and our sexuality is no exception. Discover the four archetypes that most affect your sexuality, and the qualities they represent. There are archetypes our ego likes and there are archetypes your ego dislikes. There are also archetypes that are easy and natural and there are those that are difficult.\n\nUse the archetypes for healing, growth, and awakening. Bring consciousness to the archetypes, so you can manifest their constructive aspects. Dissolve the destructive patterns that stand between you and your highest fulfilment.\n\nSpeaker: Andrea Cairella\nTalk: How to Talk Frankly About Sex in a Relationship\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re talking about is not the issue; how you are talking is important.\u201d\n\nOpening to conscious sexuality requires vulnerability. How do we create the trust and safety to speak honestly to one another about or deepest fears and needs?\n\nCommunication is the key. We must learn how to communicate without defensiveness.\n\nOur defences arise from our shadow aspects, unseen barriers which produce fear and shame. We must learn to connect with and own our shadow aspects.\n\nEmpathy and validation will help support your partner to drop their defences and explore their own shadow.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Elsbeth Meuth and Freddy Zental\nTalk: Letting Go Fully in the Bedroom\n\n\u201cExpectation is a preoccupation which is the enemy of flowing energy.\u201d\n\nDr. Elsbeth Meuth and Freddy Zental shine a light on the hidden enemy of our sexual fulfilment \u2013 expectations. Expectations are what ultimately disconnect us from our Self and our partner. Expectations stop the flow of intimacy and make it very hard for us to let go and enjoy the process. When we have the opportunity to learn to be with what is, there is no need for stagnation.\n\nAsk yourself: How can you let go of expectations you have held for years? How can we meet our partner with complete acceptance and presence?\n\nSpeaker: Mali Apples and Joe Dunn\nTalk: How Couples Can Support Each Other in Sexual Healing\n\n\u201cBeing vulnerable is the key to intimacy.\u201d\n\nMany people suffer from self-judgement, and even self-hatred, when it comes to sexuality. Conscious sexuality can be the pathway to healing shame, fear, and guilt around sexuality.\n\nAcceptance, tenderness, and trust are essential. Cultivate gratitude for the gift of your partner.\n\nAny disconnection or uncomfortable areas in sexuality are opportunities for a deeper connection. The support of a partner can allow old pains to be brought to consciousness and healed.\n\nCreate a space where each partner is able to be their best self, to heal, to see each other\u2019s potential, and to support one another to express that potential.\n\nSpeaker: Charles Muir\nTalk: Tantric Sex for Beginners\n\n\u201cThe biggest obstacle for people is the assumption they are already born with knowledge of love-making.\u201d\n\nHow many people\u2019s sex education include the idea of sacred sexuality?\n\nSexual energy is our fuel for enlightenment, and Tantra is about awakening more consciousness. Tantric practice can not only remove emotional and sexual blocks; it can renew our souls.\n\nEvery nerve ending can be an erogenous zone. How much do you know about the many intense pleasure spots on your body?\n\nExplore your own orgasmic map of spiritual sexuality!\n\nSpeaker: Shashi Solluna \nTalk:\u00a0How to Heal and Solve Your Problems with Orgasms\n\n\u201cBeing orgasmic in life is complete changing the way how we see and perceive our lives.\u201d\n\nHave we been thinking about orgasms all wrong?\n\nShashi Solluna outlines a powerful practice for bringing orgasmic energy to our entire lives. Use orgasmic energy for healing, transformation, and awakening. Expand the tightness that comes with problems and fears of the orgasmic energy. Simply meet sexual energy with expansion instead of contraction. For example: Speak your problems out loud while you are feeling orgasmically turned on.\n\nBreak through the attachment to suffering. Use orgasmic energy to solve any problem.\n\nSpeaker: Olivia Bryant \nTalk: The Journey to Cervical Bliss\n\n\u201cThe cervix is a trigger point for orgasm. A connection back to spirit\u201d\n\nThe cervix lies deep within a woman\u2019s body, and reflects the woman\u2019s psyche. The cervix reacts to outer circumstances. If your heart is shut down, your vagina will be shut down and your cervix contracted.\n\nMany women are dissociated from their cervix \u2013 it is completely numb. This can be a result of emotional or sexual trauma, disrespectful relationships, or self-punishing thought habits.\n\nReawakening the cervix is the key to reawakening our soul.\n\nHomeplay: Discover your cervix. Acknowledge it. And love it.\n\nSpeaker: Barbara Carrellas \nTalk: Spicing Up Your Bedroom With Tantric BDSM\n\n\u201cPower is one of the most confusing and unhealed issues on the planet. We need to learn what it is, how it works and how to use it consciously.\u201d\n\nBarbara Carrellas introduces Tantric BDSM \u2013 using conscious power exchange and intense sensation to enhance Tantric sexuality.\n\nTantric sex doesn\u2019t have to be soft and slow. Making love in any form can be Tantric sexuality. We can play with power as we do with any other form of energy.\n\nThe giver must know how to befully in the present moment, and how to take responsibility. The receiver must be clear about what they need to completely surrender.\n\nErotic feedback and communication are key.\n\nSpeaker: Laurie Handlers\nTalk: Manifesting Your Desires With Sex Magic\n\n\u201cInstead of trying and working hard. I set my orgasm to do the work.\u201d\n\nLaurie Handlers explains how to use sexual energy to make real changes in the world.\n\nThere are four kinds of sex: procreational, recreational, restorative, and transformational. Sex magic happens with restorative and transformational sex.\n\nSexual energy can create a new life, which means it has the power to cause change at every level \u2013 even the physical. Sex magic is the deliberate use of sexual energy to fuel your intentions.\n\nWith restorative sex, you can make real changes in the body, including healing traumas, removing stress, and releasing stored tensions. With transformational sex, you can reach a state of consciousness which feels like floating in the cosmos. In this state of consciousness, any clearly held intention is immediately translated into action.\n\nSex Magic trick: In the moment of orgasm, plug into your desires, something very specific and imagine your sexual energy fuelling your suggestion.\n\nSpeaker: Drew Gerald\nTalk: The Art of Conscious Foreplay\n\n\u201cEverything is sex, but sex isn\u2019t everything\u201d\n\nDrew Gerald highlights the weakness of the traditional, linear view of foreplay heading towards sex.\n\nMany people avoid foreplay because of the damaging expectations, habits, performance pressures, or fears they have developed around sex and intimacy.\n\nA change of mindset, taking the focus of sex away from penetrative intercourse, can open up a whole new world of pleasure.\n\nExplore the world of non-linear sexuality by redefining its chronology.\n\nSpeaker: Triambika Ma Vive\nTalk: How Any Man Can Become an Extraordinary Lover\n\n\u201cA man who has the ability to be present in his actions has a huge advantage.\u201d\n\nTriambika shows that every man already has everything he needs to become an extraordinary lover.\n\nMen can easily feel intimidated in today\u2019s society, where empowered women use masculine qualities to succeed in a masculine world, and men are shamed for their sexual desires.\n\nTriambika brings the liberating message that today\u2019s enlightened women truly want men\u2019s desire. Desire between the masculine and the feminine is an essential force in the Universe. To suppress your sexuality is to suppress your vitality, your power, and your very self.\n\nAll men need is to use presence and awareness to channel their desire in ways that nourish them and bring life to their interactions.\n\nSpeaker: Frank Mondeose\nTalk: Living Authentic and Conscious Masculinity\n\n\u201cLove is giving.\u201d\n\nFrank Mondeose puts the spotlight on masculinity.\n\nMen need to change their definition of what sexuality means. We need to move beyond what society and the media tell us. If you come from a place of conditioned sexuality, you will be in your mind and operate from your mind. Conscious sexuality is about connecting with your energies, your body, and your soul.\n\nIt is time for men to redefine their role. Step away from fear-based models of masculinity. Understand that we are the creators of our life. Create a life based on love, not on fear.\n\nAuthentic masculinity involves holding space for things to happen in your presence, creating safety so that the creative force of life can emerge, and witnessing without judgement.\n\nSpeaker: Raffaello Manacorda\nTalk: Hack Ejaculation and Last Longer\n\n\u201cMen need to unlearn the pattern of trying to reach orgasm as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nRaffaello Manacorda introduces a revolutionary approach to male sexuality. When sex is a race to a goal, something profound is lost. Men and women are different. Women take longer to reach orgasmic peaks, so a man must learn to pace himself to truly satisfy a woman.\n\nWhat happens in a man\u2019s physiology when he learns how to make love for hours without ejaculating at all?\n\nMen can experience sexual satisfaction, orgasm (even multiple orgasms) and intense, long-lasting pleasure, without any \u201clet down\u201d afterward. The resulting energy high creates a stronger bond with his partner, opens up transformative experiences, and can be channelled into work, spiritual practice, or creative processes.\n\nSpeaker: Caroline Muir\nTalk: Living a Turned-On Divine Feminine Life\n\n\u201cOur sexual energy fuels our mind and fuels our consciousness.\u201d\n\nCaroline Muir speaks about feminine sexual energy. Many women give away their power by waiting and longing to be loved, wanted and desired by another person. Without a connection to the Divine Feminine, women feel lonely and incomplete.\n\nThe solution is not to look outside, but to connect to the feminine essence within. Women who are connected with the divine feminine can bring the feminine qualities of joy and giving to a harsh, masculinized world.\n\nCaroline shares a surprising physical exercise, squeezing the Yoni muscle, that reconnect us with the feminine core in almost no time.\n\nSpeaker: Sofia Sundari\nTalk: Awaken Your Yoni Powers\n\n\u201cOur Yoni is our powerhouse where our intuition is, where we can release a lot of shame and feel more free.\u201d\n\nSofia Sundari explains the importance of a deep connection between the mind, the heart, and the yoni. We can access happiness, and even deep wisdom, when we access our yoni.\n\nExpressing our erotic essence is natural, but our culture shames and suppresses our natural sexual expression. Many women disconnect partly or completely from their vaginas, and their own power.\n\nThe yoni egg practice is an apparently simple tool to forge a profound connection with our feminine power.\n\nSpeaker: Amrita Grace\nTalk: How Loving Your Breasts Will Change Your Life\n\n\u201cBreasts are connected to the heart chakra. When we are disconnected from our breasts, we are disconnected from our heart.\u201d\n\nAmrita Grace examines the damaging impact of our culture\u2019s poor relationship with breasts.\n\nWomen\u2019s breasts have been sexualized in the past century. In fact, they have been over-sexualised. Breast size and shape has become an important element of sexual attractiveness, leading to self-esteem issues for whichever women don\u2019t fit the fashion trend of the day for breasts.\n\nIn addition, breasts are confined in bras\u00a0and subjected to a range of environmental toxins.\n\nWe can heal a lot with awareness and getting in touch with our bodies.\n\nBreast massages, deep breaths, and loving intentions are a great way to reconnect with your breasts and your heart.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Patti Britton\nTalk: Breaking Through Shame\n\n\u201c90% of our sexual problems are created by our mind.\u201d\n\nToxic shame causes many problems and blockages. Many people have shame about their body. Many people hold back from expressing themselves, exploring their sexuality, or loving themselves, because of shame. Negative self-talk shuts us down sexually, and makes us less available for connection and pleasure.\n\nWe can restructure our neural pathways, and replace negative self-talk with positive messages about ourselves. Mirror work is an excellent place to start the process: Look in the mirror and instead of analyzing the things you hate about yourself, try to look at the things you love and appreciate about your body.\n\nSpeaker: Susana Frioni\nTalk: Igniting Your Erotic Power Through Sacred Dance\n\n\u201cSpontaneity, play, fun and excitement are magic ingredients when it comes to the sexual arena.\u201d\n\nSusana Frioni unveils the many ways that sacred dance can open you up to more authenticity, power, and freedom.\n\nErotic power is the natural force of our authentic being. The more we are suppressed, distorted, and limited in our authenticity, the less we will be able to tap into our erotic nature.\n\nSacred dance is a portal to self-discovery, a secret passage through the layers of conditioning which otherwise would keep us bound.\n\nThrough sacred dance, we access states of deep connection, freedom, power, aliveness, openness, and confidence. We can then bring these states to the whole of life, including our sexual expression.\n\nDiscover the power of sacred dance by simply: DANCING!\n\nSpeaker: Rosie Rees\nTalk: Journey to a Positive Body Image\n\n\u201cGetting naked is a beautiful metaphor of letting go of what no longer serves us\u201d\n\nRosie Rees takes us on a journey to positive body image.\n\nWe have unrealistic expectations for our appearance. We are all unique, but we are held to a very narrow standard of beauty. Nine out of ten women dislike their bodies.\n\nBeing confident with your naked body is vital for sexual confidence.\n\nBeing naked is our natural state. We need to normalise nudity.\n\nHomework: Be more naked. Start with home or during sleeping and take it from there.\n\nSpeaker: Lady Shepsa\nTalk: Unleashing Female Full-Body Orgasm\n\n\u201cReclaiming your body and the sacredness of your body helps you be orgasmic.\u201d\n\nFull body orgasms move throughout the whole body, instead of being localised at the genitals. The full body orgasm brings healing, spiritual connection, and a deeper connection to your partner.\n\nThey generate a powerful creative energy, which we can use for healing, manifesting our intentions, and attracting partners of a different quality.\n\nReclaim your body, own your sexual energy fully, use your breath\u00a0to guide it through your whole body and access full body orgasms.\n\nSpeaker: Eyal Matsliah\nTalk: Decoding Male Orgasm\n\n\u201cIf you want to have amazing sex, you have to know how to have amazing sex with yourself.\u201d\n\nEyal Masliah decodes the mysteries of the male orgasm. The general definition of male orgasm is a fast ejaculation as an\u00a0end goal. In order to decode male pleasure men has to gain complete control over his ejaculation reflex. In order to do that you \u00a0to start to get to know your own body. You have to transform masturbation into a self-love, self-pleasure and connection practice.\n\nMen need to know how to have amazing sex with themselves first.\n\nSpeaker: Samiel Carolina\nTalk:\u00a0Liberate the Glowing Woman Within\n\n\u201cA glowing woman feels herself first, so she can be generous in her connection with others.\u201d\n\nSamiel Carolina reveals the secrets of a glowing life.\n\nGlowing happens when we feel comfortable in our own skin, when we dare to be ourselves, and we show up in our authenticity.\n\nIf we aren\u2019t connecting deeply with ourselves, we can\u2019t connect deeply with others.\n\nMany people look outside themselves for connection, but this is pointless if we haven\u2019t first connected with ourselves. When we live our lives focused on meeting outside expectations, we lose our connection with our authentic selves.\n\nWe need to ask ourselves \u2013 what fills us up? What gives us pleasure? What are our passions?\n\nWe need to slow down, to make space for the answers to these questions to emerge.\n\nWhen we connect with our inner child, our joyous self-expression, we can live a glowing life.\n\n\u2026\n\nSo\u2026 I hope that helps!

Understanding the Energy Orgasm\n\n\n\nThink of the best orgasm you\u2019ve ever had in your entire life.\n\nNow, what if you could have that orgasm again (and again, and again) but make it out of this world \u2013 more intense, lasting for hours\u2026 and all by yourself?\n\nEnter the tantric energy orgasm \u2013 a way to give yourself the best orgasm of your life through your own mind (no partner needed here!). Let\u2019s take a look at what an energy orgasm is, and the best way to get you on your way to experience your own.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s an orgasm that you create entirely in by yourself in your own mind and body. Sounds crazy, huh? It\u2019s not, so don\u2019t let it scare you. Let\u2019s delve into what makes energy orgasms different to your everyday physical ones on the surface.\n\nSo many of us believe that an orgasm is a purely physical reaction to pleasure. But, what if you could unlock other parts of yourself\u2026 your mind and soul, to add to that pleasure as well? Of course, it would make it better, and bigger! Energy orgasms focus on just that \u2013 your energy, rather than physical cues.\n\nDid you know your body has seven \u2018energy centers\u2019?\n\nYep! These centers are where energy orgasms are channeled and made. They basically let you connect your spiritual body with your physical one, align everything and release all of your sexual energy from deep inside to give you a more fulfilling orgasm.\n\nThe science behind the whole thing says focusing on your energy can massively increase the way your nervous system responds to unconscious actions that you normally can\u2019t control. Since, as humans, we are pretty much walking orbs of energy, tapping into different frequencies and vibrations allows us to unlock energy fields\u2026. And more pleasure. Pretty cool, huh?\n\nHave you ever been having sex or trying to orgasm, and you start thinking of\u2026 work? How busy you are? Or how you just can\u2019t orgasm at all? Mental blocks are some of the biggest reasons why people don\u2019t get to the finish line in the bedroom or find the pleasure they do get at the end unfulfilling.\n\nHarnessing and working on your tantric energy can allow you to break down mental barriers linked with orgasms and get you into space where your orgasm is not only deeper but more pleasurable. That\u2019s one of the reasons trying out energy orgasms solo is so great \u2013 it gives you space to truly tap into your sexuality without judgment or limits.\n\nThink about how deep your pleasure could run if you weren\u2019t actually thinking about anything at all. That\u2019s the whole point \u2013 getting your mind to fully open up and allow you to harness all that sexual energy by yourself once and for all!\n\nI know, I know\u2026 it sounds ridiculous and crazy. But once you let go of those thoughts, you are already starting to break down the walls that will allow you to have orgasms in such a different way. It\u2019s time to trade in fast-food sex for gourmet sex.\n\nThink about most sexual encounters you\u2019ve ever had\u2026 there\u2019s foreplay, you peak at your orgasm and then fall back to normal. Being able to catch all of that sexual energy and build it up for yourself means that you can have a marathon by yourself without anybody touching you once (including yourself!) because you are totally in charge. Okay, let\u2019s cut to it.\n\nWith Tantra you can make your sexual pleasure last for hours all over your entire body.\n\nHow many physical orgasms have you had can you say the same about? You know that little ledge you sit on right before you cum\u2026. By practicing energy orgasms, you can sit there for hours or even days and carry it throughout your body until you are ready to let go.\n\nAs we now know, energy orgasms are found when you unlock your inner Tantra. Don\u2019t be shy or scared \u2013 by opening yourself up to Trying Tantra, you are halfway there, and energy orgasms are the perfect way to get started because you get to learn by yourself. Let\u2019s get you started.\n\nStarting off is quite similar to some breathing techniques used in yoga, so if you are already doing some yoga that\u2019s awesome. If not, that\u2019s absolutely fine. Remember, if you put more effort into harnessing your energy at the start it will mean a bigger payoff at the end.\n\nStart off by lying down and bending your knees up slightly. Then, take some deep breaths and let your mind go completely. As you start to feel the breath going down your body, start to take deeper breaths\u2026 inhaling through your nose and out through your mouth.\n\nRemember how earlier we talked about opening up your mind? Now is the time to do it. You need to completely let all of your thoughts go and open your mind up to the idea of having an energy orgasm.\n\nDon\u2019t force it, just relax and receive the energy you are creating.\n\nIf you start to feel any tingling, sensations, vibrations\u2026 let them happen and don\u2019t shy away from them. Become aware of them and say \u2018yes\u2019.\n\nNow that you have opened yourself up fully to the idea of giving yourself an energy orgasm and you have the energy moving through your body, the next step is letting yourself ride the wave of your orgasm so it will continue for as long as you want it to. Remember to keep breathing, feeling, opening yourself and connecting so that your energy keeps building up inside you.\n\nHere is where you may start to feel some strange things\u2026 You may want to cry or laugh, memories may start to creep in, you might start to feel frustrated. Don\u2019t panic \u2013 these are just some ways that your mind is trying to mentally block your orgasm. Just continue to breathe and keep opening yourself up and allow the orgasm to move through your body.\n\nLearning about Tantra energy isn\u2019t about getting a quick orgasm under your belt.\n\nIt\u2019s much more than that, and that\u2019s why it is sooo much more rewarding in the long run. By learning how to create and control energy throughout your body, you have the perfect tools to create an orgasm that has absolutely no boundaries.\n\nYou will get complete control over how long your orgasm lasts, how pleasurable it will be\u2026 and you don\u2019t need anyone else to get you there! So, we\u2019ve given you the keys\u2026 What are you waiting for? Go unlock the best orgasm of your life!<|endoftext|>"}

With that said, there are definitely some days I would take an erotic massage over sex in a heartbeat. And this actually makes perfect sense as our brain releases the same feel-good chemicals as it does when we are getting busy between the sheets.\n\nIn general, a traditional massage involves rubbing the muscles with light gliding strokes. The goal of a traditional massage is to relax the entire body as well as work out kinks in the body. But what about Erotic massage? Well, that\u2019s where it gets a bit more sultry.\n\nThe main difference between traditional massage and sexual massage is, well you can probably guess: sexual arousal.\n\nCurious about how to give a sensual massage? It is indeed not rocket science, but there are some basic techniques you should learn before getting started.\n\nIf you really want to know how to give an out-of-this-world massage, you can start by using the following erotic massage techniques.\n\nListen closely, there is so much to soak up in the sensual territory of hot erotic massage techniques!\n\nTable of ContentsThe Erotic Massage Vs. The Traditional MassageWhat About Tantric Yoni Massage?How To Erotic Massage: Six Sexual Massage TipsTip #1: Dim The Lights: Set The MoodTip #2: Use Sexy and SAFE CommunicationTip #3: Props, Oils, and Toys Oh My!Tip #4: The Right Kind of TouchAnd finally, tracingTip #5: Edging and Getting Your Partner From Calm to ClimaxTip #6: Take Sex Off The TableMake Your Fingers Work Their Magic\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGenerally, when we think of massages, we think of traditional massage. As mentioned above, a traditional massage usually involves rubbing and kneading of muscles of the body with the hands. Its primary intention is to relieve tension or pain.\n\nWhile traditional massage may manifest feelings of arousal, it\u2019s certainly not the goal.\n\nTraditional massages leave out \u201cprivate zones\u201d. Meaning, in a traditional massage, there should be no poking or prodding whatsoever of or around the genitals. Erotic massage, on the other hand, is explicitly used to tap into a person\u2019s erogenous zones.\n\nAn erotic massage is where all your happy ending fantasies come true.\n\nWith that said, there are many different types of massage therapies you can incorporate into your erotic massage. Once you have nailed down the basics of erotic massage, you can certainly incorporate more mainstream techniques.\n\nAnd massage techniques such as hot stone massage, or aromatherapy can be a great way to \u201cup-your-game\u201d.\n\nFor ideas on more traditional massage therapies check out the basic strokes of Swedish massage.\n\nYou have probably heard about Tantric Yoni Massage. Tantric Yoni Massage taps into the idea of sacred sexuality. This particular type of massage is used to target the woman\u2019s vagina while learning to approach it with the utmost love and adoration. Whereas erotic massage focuses on arousal, tantric massages focus is on healing and tend to be more mindful.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the secrets of Yoni massage, you can check out: Yoni Massage, The# One Practice for Pleasure Healing and Connection.\n\nAt the end of the day, a good erotic massage differs from traditional massage because its primary objective is to enhance sexual stimulation. If an erotic massage results in an orgasm that\u2019s pretty awesome too, but it\u2019s not the goal.\n\nBy integrating the following sexual massage tips, erotic massage can be damn well near orgasmic. Furthermore, these tips can actually help boost overall sexual happiness and connection between you and your partner.\n\nNot everyone likes to get down and dirty with the lights off. If you are anything like me, you actually prefer to see your partner in the nude clearly. Whether you prefer lights on or off, setting the mood prior to an erotic massage is vital.\n\nIn general, women tend to be more sensitive to the cues from their environment than men. In other words, a woman\u2019s brain is much more susceptible to being turned off or on if the mood isn\u2019t quite right. If you are looking for erotic massage techniques for her, it is best to figure out when she will menstruate next.\n\nWhy is it important to keep tabs on your partner\u2019s Aunt Flo? Well, according to Dr. Louann Brizendine, the author of \u201cThe Female Brain\u201d women are hornier about 10 days after the onset of menstruation, right before ovulation.\n\nSo, if you are looking to give your female partner a sensual rub-down, ask her thoughtfully when she menstruated last.\n\nWhether you are giving a massage to your male or female partner, music will play an essential role in setting the mood. That is to say, neither heavy metal nor cheesy elevator music is probably the right choice when choosing a sexy playlist. If you really want to dance your partner\u2019s pants off choose soft rhythmic beats.\n\nShort on ideas? Try this sassy Spotify mix: relaxing music to love.\n\nOther sexy erotic massage techniques that can help \u201cset the mood\u201d include, sensual lighting. Start by using warm or earthy colors to make your partner feel cozy and loved. This could mean using a few tapestries to cover stark white walls. Want to really spice things up?\n\nUse some sexy mood lighting, and no, I am not talking about the lava lamp you used as a kid.\n\nIf you really want to make the erotic massage extra sensual, try hanging up some Christmas lights and a few strategic candles. Want to crank up the kink even more? Then spark it up with some deliciously scented erotic aromas like jasmine or sandalwood, to really set the stage for hot and spa-like sensual massage.\n\nSpeaking of candles, hot massage candles can be great for a little bit of sexy wax play \u2013 but more on that later. Ultimately, one of the most Important things to consider when \u201csetting the mood\u201d is time.\n\nErotic massage is all about tantalizing the receiving partner\u2019s arousal, and this of course takes time.\n\nTherefore, make sure you choose a time when you have nothing else going on. That means turning your phone ringer and Facebook notifications to silent.\n\nI can\u2019t stress enough how crucial safe communication is during any type of erotic play. Therefore, before performing any erotic massage techniques, it is absolutely vital to check in with your partner.\n\nThere may be parts of the body that your partner prefers to flag as \u201coff limits\u201d. Safe communication is an absolute must and a recent study suggests that people who communicate their likes and dislikes to their partners during sex are more sexually satisfied.\n\nUsing safe techniques during an erotic massage can actually be very fun and empowering!\n\nThat\u2019s because secure and sexy communication develops trust between two people. Obviously right? To help you get started, below are some simple ways you effectively incorporate communication in a sexy and safe way.\n\nAlways start slow using the hand as a starting point. Experiment with a few strokes on the palm and have your partner vocalize things like \u201cYes that feels good\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t like that\u201d or \u201cKeep going\u201d.\n\nDefine safe words if things get too heavy or uncomfortable.\u00a0 These words can be as simple as \u201cstop\u201d or, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t feel so good\u201d. If words seem to blunt, you and your partner can also establish safe sounds or gestures that will stop or slow down the erotic touch immediately.\n\nKeep the verbal communication flowing from the initiation of the erotic massage to the conclusion.\n\nThe receiving partner is given the freedom to speak up, while the giving partner is welcome to ask the receiver questions when they need feedback.\n\nCheck in after the massage is over.See what came up for your partner. Be empathetic and understanding.\n\nNow that we have our secure communication defined, let\u2019s move on. Things are about to get a little slippery.\n\nEver dreamed about an erotic massage using oil, wax or toys? Along with setting the mood, pleasure can be enhanced in an erotic massage by using things like hot candle wax or natural oils. My favorite lube to use for erotic massage is coconut oil. Coconut oil is ideal because it is safe for both inside and outside parts.\n\nFurthermore, natural oils like five tablespoons of honey mixed with two cups of almond oil and two tablespoons of rose oil can really help lather up your partner\u2019s sultry folds. You can also check out synthetic oils like, LoveHoney edible massage oils, that are non-toxic and edible and great to use in the bedroom.\n\nIf you are feeling extra randy, you can use hot candle wax that is made for massage play.\n\nBut be careful, not all candle wax is equal. Third-degree burns are the opposite of a happy ending to an erotic massage. To safely use candle wax during a massage, make sure you are using candles that are designed explicitly for erotic play.\n\nToys are not essential when performing an erotic massage, but they can add some zest. If you want to incorporate toys, keep them simple. These can include a handheld massager like this one that can travel with you anywhere. You can also use a dildo for a better orgasm.\n\nA weekend getaway filled with an erotic massage and a traveling vibrator? Get ready for your receiving partner to melt into a puddle of passionate mush, while screaming out your name. Oh Yes!\n\nHonestly, there are so many touch techniques you can use when giving an erotic massage. To simplify things, I am going to offer a method called \u201cfingertips to kneading\u201d.\n\nMany of these techniques come from \u201cSwedish massage\u201d, which is probably the best-known type of bodywork performed today.\n\nYou can surprise your partner by integrating a few of the following refined touch tactics into your erotic massage.\n\nWhile experimenting with these techniques, you may find that your partner prefers more pressure or less. Either way, it\u2019s essential to start with light feathery fingertip massaging, to begin with. This will help escalate arousal.\n\nWhen it comes to kneading, you can use your thumb to work into deeper tissue around the muscles.\n\nThere are a few sensual massage techniques you can use to increase the pleasure factor of kneading:\n\nWhatever technique you incorporate into your erotic massage, the idea is to trace your partner\u2019s body. It is important to use very light touch initially.\n\nFrom there, you can begin to massage from the head to the feet while gradually increasing pressure little by little. To do this, you can start by asking your partner to lie on their back.\n\nWhen you feel like your partner is relaxed enough, ask them nicely to turn over. Apply the same techniques to their front as you did to their back, massaging their shoulders, arms, legs, thighs and eventually heading to their sexy bits.\n\nYou know that intense warm-fuzzy feeling that takes over every inch of your body leading up to an orgasm? Remember that feeling and stop right there. This is the feeling you want to elicit in your partner during an erotic massage.\n\nBringing your partner from calm to climax will not only heighten arousal but, will also drive your lover wild.\n\nThis \u2018secret\u2019 is a technique called edging, otherwise known as orgasm control. According to Jordan Gray, a sex and relationship coach, escalation is key to a fulfilling erotic massage \u201cThe arc of the sensual massage is a giant tease from initial feather-light touch on the back to full manual stimulation of her lady parts\u201d. For this reason, he urges not to race to the finish line.\n\nKeeping that in mind, the following \u201cedging\u201d techniques can keep your partner literally \u201con edge\u201d and make a juicy massage that much more juicy.\n\nPlay around with arousal with your partner. Trace your partner moving from the outline of their body inward towards their genitals. Experiment with the fingertip and kneading massage techniques listed above. When your partner becomes highly aroused, slow down the kneading always staying connected to their body with a firm touch.\n\nIncorporate a vibrator into the erotic massage. Use different levels of vibration and refer back to technique #1 if an orgasm is on the horizon. In other words, stop while you are ahead, retreat, and repeat.\n\nMany women think that the penis is the only place a man can generate pleasure. This is so far from the truth. You can use Perpetual Edging in erotic massage by using your hands to cup and massage your man\u2019s scrotum. You can also experiment with very light pinching on the skin of the scrotum.\n\nRemember that if your partner doesn\u2019t reach it\u2019s not the end of the world. While giving pleasure is the main goal of the massage and orgasms may be part of that, don\u2019t worry if your partner doesn\u2019t climax.\n\nWith that in mind, some techniques focus explicitly on the genital area itself. These techniques may or may not bring your partner to a full climax, which is okay. Either way, make sure you focus on the previous \u201cedging\u201d techniques before incorporating the following genital stimulation techniques.\n\nThis stroke can provide the receiver with some exciting sensations. Surround the lingam with both hands and twist them in opposite directions. Keep a firm grip, but don\u2019t squeeze too hard here. You can also check our Lingam Massage Guide.\n\nThe headstroke is for your male partner\u2019s second \u201chead\u201d. You know, the one below the waistline that does all the sensual thinking. To do the headstroke, cup his cock head with your palm. Place your thumb and index finger under his mushroom tip and start to twist your fingers back and forth.\n\nUse this technique to warm up your partner\u2019s yoni (vagina). Place your left hand on her heart, and the right hand on her yoni. Continue to step 4.\n\nBegin to firmly squeeze her outer lips and clitoris from top to bottom. Use your thumb and index finger to grip.\n\nPersonally, when looking for pornography, my favorite title to search is \u201cno sex, just erotic massage\u201d. That\u2019s right!Contrary to popular belief, erotic massage is actually not about the sex.\n\nThrefore, the focus of erotic massage should be more about tension and buildup.\n\nFor this reason, many experts agree that it is important to take sex off the table before giving an erotic massage.\n\nWhile it may seem boring, erotic massage that doesn\u2019t end in sex can be ten times more sexually exhilarating than actual sex itself. If you follow the tips listed above, I can almost guarantee you that your partner will be on their knees begging for sex by the end of the massage.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if you give in, but the idea is to keep your partner right on the edge. Either way, let your partner guide you! Listen to their sighs, grunts, and squeals of arousal. These will be your cues to staying right on the line before climax takes over.\n\nErotic massage can open the door to a tunnel of tantalizing sexuality. In fact, it could be that extra spark that relights the fire between you and your lover. So what do you think? Are you ready to get your hands wet and wild in the land of erotic massage? My advice?\n\nGet creative with your partner and paint outside the lines.\n\nWhat feels good for one person may not feel good for the next. Check in with integrity and stay open. Intentional Erotic massage is possibly one of the best ways to reach a heavenly full-body orgasm. And who doesn\u2019t want that?<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Looking for a G-Spot Vibrator? Add One of These to Your Collection\n\n\n\nThe g-spot is a long-debated hot spot of the female body. A\u00a02011 study published in ISRN Obstetrics and Gynecology\u00a0found that no physical g-spot existed\u2026 It turns out it is actually an area of high sensitivity that is connected to your magical clitoris!\n\nHence it feeling so damn good when stimulated.\n\nBut, actually stimulating the g-spot can be tricky. Penetrative sex tends to slide right past this spot which is why so few women are able to orgasm from this kind of stimulation alone.\n\nThis\u00a02018 study published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy\u00a0concluded that only 18% of female respondents can! But, that is where g-spot vibrators can help. They are designed to make that g-spot orgasm a little less elusive (and help you experience Squirting).\n\nLube up those fingers and get exploring. This area is located about 2-5 inches in, on the top vaginal wall towards your belly button. It has a ruffled texture so you should be able to tell when you get it. Use the \u201ccome hither\u201d motion with your fingers to stimulate the area and see how it feels for you.\n\nThis is the defining feature of a g-spot toy. If it is curved or bulbous at the tip, then it is perfect for g-spot stimulation. The tip can be rounded or flat but look for a toy with enough surface area to really massage as much of the g-spot as possible.\n\nLook out for a material you know is body-safe! Silicone is ideal as it is non-toxic and completely body-safe. Silicone can be firm or have a little squish to it. Either way, it will be super soft to touch and feel great against your skin. If you do go with silicone, look out for a toy with a firm inner core as that extra pressure will feel amazing.\n\nWhat I love about g-spot vibrators is that the size doesn\u2019t really matter so long as you get the shape right. However, think about what you like when making a decision. Think about the girth and length of the toy. If you want something thick, then look for a toy with a curved tip. If you want something slim, ensure you choose a toy with a bulbous tip so you still get that g-spot stimulation!\n\nDo you want something with batteries or a vibe that is USB rechargeable? What will work best for your own lifestyle? If you travel a lot, then rechargeable will probably be a lot easier. And, as a general rule, rechargeable toys will have stronger vibrations than battery options.\n\nThe best thing you can do is lube it on up! Using lube on the toy and the opening of your vagina will keep things smooth, slippery and oh so pleasurable. Also, test out the settings and speeds before you play.\n\nAnd, when you do insert the toy, start with it turned off. Then, when you are ready, turn on the vibration and see how it feels. Once you get in the groove, you can turn it on up!\n\nExplore and have fun with it!\n\nTry to massage the g-spot but also play with thrusts and small circles. And, if you want to, wiggle with it a little. A\u00a02018 study published in The Journal of Sex Research\u00a0found that females that moved their body around a lot during sex were more likely to reach orgasm.\n\nG-Spot Vibrators\n\nThis g-spot vibrator is fan favorite amongst the sex toy reviewer community, and for good reason. The Gigi 2 is a g-spot vibe from the luxury brand LELO. They make gorgeous, high-quality sex toys for those that love a luxury orgasm.\n\nThis is another vibe that is made from silicone but still has a nice firm core so you get all that lovely pressure right against the g-spot. In fact, they even flattened out the tip of the toy to make sure you get even more pressure and a wider surface area for massage. Thanks, LELO!\n\nThis one is also USB rechargeable and waterproof for when you just need to get wet while you play! There are 8 different vibration patterns but, the higher levels do start to get a bit buzzy, so if you really love power, this might not be the best option. And, as you can likely guess, being a LELO product, it is on the pricey side.\n\nG-Spot Vibrators\n\nAny power queens out there? The ladies that need a little extra when it comes to getting off? This one \u2018s for you. The We-Vibe Rave is all about those deep, strong vibrations right where you like them.\n\nPlus, that thick, curved shaft is heading straight for your g-spot while offering stimulation throughout the vagina too. It\u2019s made from body-safe silicone with a firm inner core. So, it will be super silky to touch but also have that nice firmness to massage the g-spot.\n\nThere are 10 different vibration patterns to choose from (I recommend the Wave), and they are all strong and rumbly and awesome. The vibe itself is USB rechargeable so no need for batteries!\n\nHowever, it\u2019s only splash proof so keep this one away from the tub! And, how could I forget?! This vibrator can be controlled using an app on your smartphone, which makes it ideal for long distance lovers.\n\nG-Spot Vibrators\n\nOk, so this is a bit of a wildcard, but I am including it because it is a whole lot of fun and it truly has a bit of everything. Like, literally. This Fun Factory vibe pulsates, vibrates, thrusts, and stimulates with a super textured shaft.\n\nAnd, (you didn\u2019t think we were done did you?), it is also a g-spot vibrator and a rabbit vibrator, so it will stimulate your clitoris too. Phew! I feel spent just thinking about it. But, if you are all about getting as much stimulation as you can from a sex toy, you might just fall in love.\n\nPlus, it has all the features you love from a g-spot vibe. A slight curve at the end to hit just the right spot, a shaft made from silicone, a waterproof design, and its USB rechargeable. But, it is not for beginners, as this is an intense toy. And it\u2019s super expensive. But, I mean, It\u2019s like 100 toys in 1!\n\nG-Spot Vibrators\n\nAlright, let\u2019s ease into it with a vibrator that is small and slim but still has curves in all the right places! This G-slim vibrator is a great option for beginners as it\u2019s slim shape won\u2019t overwhelm you. But, that nice bulbous tip will still target the g-spot directly.\n\nThis vibe is made from ABS plastic which is a very firm material that can be used with any type of lubricant. Now, I know the term \u2018firm\u2019 can be off-putting, but g-spot stimulation is really all about pressure, and that is exactly what you will get from this toy. Promise!\n\nIt\u2019s a multispeed vibrator with a simple twist-turn base to increase or decrease the power making it really easy to use. But, it is battery operated which means that the vibrations will not be as intense as some other options.\n\nG-Spot Vibrators\n\nThis g-spot vibe by Je Joue brings all that rumbly goodness in a cute little package! This vibrator is small, discreet and seriously quiet to use. It can also be used as a clitoral vibrator, so you are really getting 2 toys in 1. No complaints here!\n\nThere are 5 speeds, starting from a low rumble to intense power, and 7 vibration patterns. This is another toy that is USB rechargeable and it\u2019s fully submersible so you can use it anywhere you like to get wet. Mmm, I think I hear the bathtub calling my name\u2026\n\nThe only issue with this vibe is that its length can actually be too short for some. It might be fine for use on the clitoris but, it won\u2019t quite reach the g-spot. It can also be tricky to control with your hand once it\u2019s all lubed up.\n\nThe LELO Gigi 2 and the We-Vibe Rave. You\u2019re both winners, baby! Those amazing curves and those strong rumbly vibrations are just too good to pass up. And that added app control feature, that the We-Vibe Rave offers, is pretty amazing too.\n\nI wish this had been around when I was in a long distance relationship!\n\nBut, both are expensive, so if you haven\u2019t tried a g-spot vibrator before, I would go for something smaller. Not everyone likes g-spot stimulation, so you might want to start off with something small and cheap and work your way up from there.\n\nDiscover Our G-Spot Online Course \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nExperience the bliss of\u00a0earth-shattering G-Spot and Squirting orgasms with the help of tried and tested techniques. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Started \u00bb\n\nDiscover Our G-Spot Online Course\n\nExperience the bliss of\u00a0earth-shattering G-Spot and Squirting orgasms with the help of tried and tested techniques.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Beducated Guide to Experience the Hands-Free Male Orgasm\n\n\n\nMale orgasms come in all shapes and sizes. You obviously know about the standard ejaculatory orgasm, and you probably know about the prostate orgasm. You may even know something about the pelvic orgasm and the blended (ejaculatory and prostate) orgasm. But have you ever thought about a hands-free male orgasm? It might be just what you need to spice things up.\n\nSo what is a hands-free male orgasm? This type of orgasm occurs when a man is stimulated through climax without the use of traditional masturbation or physical contact with his hands. If this sounds tricky, you\u2019re right.\n\nA hands-free orgasm for men is not an easy feat.\n\nIt takes practice! But the mind is very powerful\u2014some even consider the brain as the most important sex organ. Your brain communicates with your genitals, and your genitals communicate with your brain.\n\nRemember that scene in 40 Days and 40 Nights when Josh Hartnett gives his girlfriend an orgasm just by blowing a flower petal all over her body? Well, the hands-free male orgasm is kinda like that, although this sexy scene depicts a female orgasm. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m getting turned on just thinking about it.\n\nAre you ready to get going with a hands-free male orgasm? Let\u2019s see how far your mind can take you!\n\nAlthough a hands-free orgasm will take patience and practice for many men, it may be easier to execute than it sounds. The hands-free climax can be reached a number of different ways including meditation, consumption of erotic content, flexing your PC (pubococcygeus) muscles, or utilizing soft, stimulating fabrics. Some men may achieve a hands-free orgasm using a combination of these methods.\n\nBefore getting started with a hands-free orgasm, it\u2019s important to let go of some of your go-to masturbation habits.\n\nYou must be willing to explore new techniques.\n\nHaving an open mind will allow you to climax without the use of your standard methods. Even though a hands-free orgasm may utilize some stimulating fabrics, you\u2019ll ultimately be reaching ejaculation through focused thought. Letting your mind wander is part of meditation, but with hands-free orgasms, it\u2019s important to remain focused on the stimulation.\n\nYou\u2019ve got an open mind, and you\u2019ve let go of your conventional self-pleasure approach. Now that your head\u2019s in the right place, following these steps will help you achieve a hands-free male orgasm.\n\nThis step is necessary for masturbation or sex of any kind. When you have time to try out a hands-free orgasm, head to a comfortable, private place where you won\u2019t be interrupted or distracted.\n\nThis is where you decide which direction to go for your hands-free male orgasm. Que up some video porn or sexy audio. You may want to just read an erotic story. Whatever you choose, remember that the goal is for the words or images to arouse your subconscious enough to reach climax.\n\nFocusing on slow, deep breathing will help you relax.\n\nBreathwork assists with bringing oxygen into your bloodstream. As your breathing calms you, start to concentrate intently on your penis. This focus will increase blood flow to your pelvic region and begin your hands-free experience.\n\nAs things start to heat up, hit play or begin reading the erotica while continuing to focus intently on your penis. Think dirty thoughts and imagine yourself getting steamy with someone. Let these images penetrate your mind and make you hard without using your hands.\n\nYou\u2019re probably used to repetitive stroking or penetration as a means for reaching orgasm and may be wondering how you can have a hands-free orgasm without this fast movement. Flexing your PC muscles continuously for a minute or two may make your penis twitch without actually touching it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll be able to ejaculate without your hands, try using fabrics before giving up. While the use of fabrics isn\u2019t a completely touchless method of attaining a hands-free orgasm, it\u2019s a great way to ease yourself into the process if you\u2019re not used to it. A soft scarf, satin pillowcase, sports jersey, piece of fur, or some silky panties may do the trick!\n\nYou\u2019ve got the time, place, imagery, and materials to get the job done. Now it\u2019s up to you to focus intently and let your mind guide you through to the big hands-free O.\n\nTry to concentrate on the hot fantasy playing out in your mind.\n\nDirect your attention to how your penis is feeling and how it would feel doing the dirty deed you\u2019re thinking about. Let your mind lead your body to an elevated hands-free masturbatory experience. Since this is a new pleasure method for you, don\u2019t be discouraged if it takes you longer than normal to finish\u2014and don\u2019t be alarmed if you ejaculate quicker than expected either!\n\nWith this new knowledge on how to achieve a hands-free male orgasm, are you feeling up to the task? Branching out from your mundane masturbatory routine and opening your mind to different climax methods will allow you to achieve greater pleasure and make you a better lover.\n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t orgasm on your first try sans hands. It may take some perseverance, but a hands-free orgasm for men is totally attainable. With a little practice, you may even be able to get there without using any fabrics or pornography.\n\nHands-free orgasm, here you cum!<|endoftext|>"}

Welcome to becoming the ultimate seducer! We\u2019ve spoken with four of the most delectable erotic dance experts to help you with the big reveal\u2026 your body!\n\nAnd the best thing about it is that anyone can do it! Guys, girls, non-binary folk! Just take a feather out of this boa and trust yourself.\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty, let\u2019s introduce the professionals:\n\nAnd now, here are the expert\u2019s 21 tips on how to do a striptease!\n\nFirst and foremost, think about the aim behind this striptease? Do you want to feel sexy for yourself or are you seducing someone? Is it about falling in love with your own body, or to playfully show off your moves? How do you want to feel and what are you trying to convey?\n\n\u201cThe intention behind it is important, so you feel good and aligned throughout the exercise,\u201d says Andreja Bourke, and \u201cthe more you know yourself, the sexier you become.\u201d\n\nWhen teaching her clients how to do a striptease, Madam Storm suggests you practice touching yourself seductively in the mirror. \u201cLook at how your body moves and fall in love with yourself, take note of how your hair falls down your neck, how your back arches when you bend over, the beauty spot on your inner thigh. Know your body inside out.\u201d\n\nSensuality and seduction start with you and your connection to yourself.\n\nMiss Polly Rae says it is about self-discovery, self-acceptance, enjoying your body regardless of insecurities, and feeling good. \u201cAnd if you feel good, anyone watching will feel good too.\u201d\n\nStorm suggests you create a lover\u2019s playlist, \u201csomething that makes you feel sexy and sensual.\u201d\n\nChoose music that turns you on, songs that make you feel sexy. Polly Rae says, \u201cthere are no rules when it comes to music as long as it makes you want to move.\u201d\n\nJones reminds us that no song is \u201cwrong\u201d! \u201cI\u2019ve seen incredible dances to country, death metal, Pop, classical opera, etc. Make sure it feels like you.\u201d\n\nEither make your playlist a certain length or have a timer handy. Andreja says to create realistic expectations, \u201csay, 30 minutes\u201d, or for as long as you feel comfortable stripping.\n\nTime to set your stage. Jones says, \u201clighting is key\u201d when figuring out how to do a striptease.\n\nTry dimming the lights or lighting some candles. Storm says she \u201calways finds the ones that are scented to be better,\u201d but you can also burn some incense to add sensual aromas to the experience.\n\nExude glamour from head to toe, says Polly Rae, with \u201cjaw-dropping lingerie, exquisite garments that accentuate in all the right places, killer heels, and a smile that weakens the knees.\u201d\n\nShe adds to make sure your lingerie choice is easy to remove, with no complicated hooks or ties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to cost a bomb either, low priced beautiful lingerie is very accessible these days.\u201d And remember, \u201cif you are preparing to perform a striptease for your partner, you may want to practice with any new garments, so you are familiar with how they come off.\u201d\n\nProtip from Andreja: layer your outfit. \u201cThe more you have on, the more you have to play with pulling off.\u201d\n\nJones suggests using sensuous fabrics such as feathers and silk. You could also grab any piece of material that makes you feel sensually aroused. Andreja says this can be scarves, socks, belts, jewelry, or even blankets.\n\nRoleplay with your character and allow your inner seducer or seductress to come out through your personality. Polly Rae says, \u201ccommit to your persona and radiate confidence. This is especially effective if you are shy. You can sneak behind a character. Think of another sexy icon that you admire and try to channel them. Get out of your head, and just let yourself go.\u201d\n\nWhen learning how to do a striptease \u201csee yourself as a seductress and create a character that allows you to express yourself freely and have fun with it,\u201d says Storm.\n\nStorm says that what works for someone else\u2019s partner may not work for yours. Remember, we all have different needs and wants, so ask your partner what they want.\n\nShe believes successful relationships have excellent communication and it\u2019s important to \u201chave fun exploring one another\u2019s desires.\u201d\n\nUsing seductive language can be a great addition. If you want to be more vocal, Storm says, \u201cwords are like spells, so cast them carefully.\u201d The tone of how you speak is what will turn your partner on, \u201cthe pace is also important, your language will heavily depend on the mood you want to set and the role you are playing.\u201d\n\nNot sure what to say? Check out our Conscious Guide to Dirty Talking.\n\nGive yourself permission to self-explore. \u201cThe more we practice self-consent, the more we are able to tap into our instincts and can choose things in a more empowered way that serves our higher self,\u201d says Andreja.\n\nShe suggests taking a moment to check in with your sensual self. Does your body want this? Do you want to be touched like this? Knowing exactly how you feel will help you to speak up when something doesn\u2019t feel right in the bedroom. Ensure that your body and mind are on the same page before doing a striptease.\n\nHaving confidence might seem like a no brainer, but Jones makes the point that everyone is likely to feel nervous when you are first learning how to do a striptease. Just \u201cpower through the initial strangeness and know that even if it dissolves into giggles, this person does find you sexy and gorgeous.\u201d\n\nShe suggests \u201cchanneling your fears into an alter ego can really help,\u201d which is where the character creation becomes helpful!\n\nEven if you don\u2019t initially feel like it, Storm says self-grooming is a must for any seducer or seductress. \u201cTaking care of yourself is a sign of self-love. It says, \u2018I\u2019ve taken the time to worship myself, and you will do the same.\u2019\u201d\n\nTake your time with your striptease. Remember, there\u2019s absolutely no rush, \u201cthe longer you take to relax and enjoy each reveal, the more exciting and effective the striptease will be,\u201d says Polly Rae.\n\nTake yourself or your partner on a journey of \u201cexcitement and suspense,\u201d using your body to entice and hypnotize, says Storm.\n\nAndreja agrees: \u201cWhy would you want to rush anything that feels pleasurable?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to literally embrace yourself,\u201d shares Jones, \u201cfeel free to touch yourself.\u201d\n\nWhen seducing your lover, everything is to be admired. Storm reveals that it\u2019s important to touch yourself erotically, the way that you want your partner to touch you. Turn yourself on, and by doing so, they will naturally be aroused. \u201cAnd remember, wherever your hands wander, their eyes will go.\u201d\n\nMake eye contact with the person you\u2019re dancing with. Jones says, \u201cdon\u2019t look down no matter how tempting it is. Eye contact draws people into your dance and is also insanely sexy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHypnotise and connect to your audience\u2013\u2013even if it is yourself in the mirror by catching their eye,\u201d says Polly Rae. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy. Hold their gaze.\u201d\n\nAs a dominatrix and seductress, Madam Storm\u2019s favorite style of stripping is using the art of domination and submission at the same time. \u201cI love playing with power dynamics. It keeps your lover on [their] toes, not knowing your next move, keeping the sense of surprise. Using your body and energy is electrifying when stripteasing.\u201d\n\nAndreja believes what\u2019s important when you\u2019re figuring out how to do a striptease is the unveiling. \u201cIt\u2019s a reveal. I think that\u2019s why people struggle with it because they haven\u2019t taken the time to look at themselves, to then share that with another feels very vulnerable.\u201d\n\nPolly Rae says that when she is stripping for her partner, she connects with herself in a more sensual way than she does when performing for an audience. Sometimes this feels even more vulnerable, \u201cbut in a way that makes me feel equally as good. I feel more connected to myself \u2026 as a sexual being.\u201d\n\nDisrobe with \u201cconfidence, sensuality, and flair,\u201d says Polly Rae. \u201cTempt and tease with your best assets. Again there are no particular rules when it comes to disrobing.\u201d\n\nHer advice is to \u201cstart with slow dance movement, get into the groove and the music, and, when the time feels right, remove each item of clothing. I always find it best to be still when removing a garment, then fill the intervals between garments with dance and movement.\u201d\n\nTake everything you just learned and put it to the back of your mind\u2013\u2013let it drift into your subconscious. The main thing to remember is to have fun when you are learning how to do a striptease! Be playful, says Andreja.\n\nOne of the ways Jones does that is with \u201clots of grinding and floor work and always a good booty shake or tassel twirl!\u201d Just have a good time.\n\n\u201cWhether you want to make it light-hearted or an absolute foreplay warm-up, remember it\u2019s for someone you love and trust.\u201d\n\nIf you want to learn more kinky treats to show off in the bedroom, check out our incredible Kinky Mastery course \u00a0in collaboration with the prodigious Pleasure Mechanics.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>How to Handle Blue Balls Like a Monk\n\n\n\nWho would have thought that the yogis worried about \u201cblue balls\u201d?\n\n\u201cBlue balls\u201d or\u00a0\u2018Epididymal Hypertension\u2019 is the colloquial name for an uncomfortable, sometimes even painful sensation that men can feel when too much blood stays in the genital area after sexual activity.\n\nTypically, the blood, which stiffens the penis and creates an erection, is released after orgasm or as a result of a decreased physical arousal. Too much blood may stay in the genital area of some people who become aroused for an extended period without a release or decrease of arousal. This can cause pain and discomfort. The testicles may even start to turn blue due to the excess blood and increase in blood pressure.\n\nIt is typically seen as something that only troubles teenage boys when they are past puberty, have a girlfriend, and aren\u2019t yet having full sexual intercourse.\n\nHowever, any spiritual tradition which requires sexual abstinence will also encounter the phenomenon of blue balls.\n\nMen learn at an early age that the easiest way to relieve the discomfort is to quickly ejaculate.\n\nThe temptation is so great that monasteries in some places have developed complex systems to make sure that new monks are never left alone for long enough to masturbate. In Thai Buddhist monasteries, for example, each new monk is accompanied 24 hours a day by an older monk \u2013 for the first five years.\n\nThe situation is even more difficult for men who practice sexual Tantra. Monks are protected from interacting with women, or in some traditions even seeing them. Those men are surrounded by the female form, representing Shakti, the source of all power in the universe.\n\nMen practicing left hand Tantra even have sexual intercourse \u2013 but they are not supposed to ejaculate.\n\nYou can only imagine the torment when a man, after a lifetime of ejaculating regularly, suddenly tries to go cold turkey.\n\nThe yogis of India were practical, rather than idealistic. They studied the workings of the human body in great detail, and they developed asanas (postures) which had specific effects.\n\nYoga asanas take time to work on the body. Hold each asana for a minimum of two minutes, and if it is a polar asana, with a left and a right side version, hold each side for at least two minutes. Aim to increase to at least five minutes as quickly as possible.\n\nIf you are experienced with the headstand, this is one of the most powerful asanas to relieve blue balls. Gravity works at the physical level, moving fluid from the scrotum into the abdominal cavity, while sublimation happens at the energetic level, converting the sexual energy into motivation and dynamism. If you are not experienced with this posture, go to a few yoga classes to ensure you can do it safely before you start practicing at home.\n\nAlmost as effective as headstand, the shoulder stand can be done by just about everyone. If you have neck or shoulder problems, visit an Iyengar yoga class to learn how to use props like chairs and pillows to perform this asana safely.\n\nStretch the legs out to the sides as far as is comfortable. Keeping the spine straight, bend at the hips, and bring your head to the floor between your feet. Place your palms or forearms on the floor, and relax.\n\nIf your hips are not flexible enough to bring your head to the floor, you can use a support for your head. You will lose some of the benefits of gravity if your spine is not vertical, but the stretching of the pelvic floor will still have great benefit.\n\nStretch the legs out to the sides as far as is comfortable. Turn to face the right leg, and bend the right leg to ninety degrees. Bend forward from the hips, taking the nose as close as possible to the big toe. If you are new to yoga, rest the right shoulder on the right thigh, rather than trying to reach the toe immediately. Repeat on the other side.\n\nSit with the spine straight. Bring the soles of your feet together, as close as possible to the perineum (pelvic floor). Keeping the spine straight, lean forward and grasp the toes.\n\nStand with the legs hip-width apart. Bend the knees slightly, and rest the hands mid-thigh. Breathe all the way out through the mouth, emptying the lungs completely. Hold for as long as possible. Breathe in through the nose, filling the lungs completely. Hold the full inhalation for as long as possible. Breathe out through the mouth. Practising this technique for 15-30 minutes per day will convert excess sexual energy to drive, willpower, and effectiveness in everyday life.\n\nIf you have access to a frozen lake, just jump in! Otherwise, immerse the scrotum in ice water for 2-3 minutes each day. Not only will this technique relieve the immediate pressure of blue balls, it also stimulates the production of testosterone. This hormone is an antidepressant and increases sex drive, ambition, and attractiveness.\n\nIt can be very difficult to resist the urge to ejaculate, especially in the early years of practice. Just remember that the end goal is worth it. You will be able to stay in a state of orgasm for hours or to have multiple orgasms, and never have your blissful state interrupted by the let-down of ejaculation.\n\nIf you know of other techniques that are also effective, please leave a comment \u2013 the other readers will thank you!<|endoftext|>"}

Be ready to mix it up and use different locations both inside and outside of the house.\n\nWhen it comes to women, it\u2019s important to take your time if you want to give her a great time. Although the lust can be so unbearable to find room for patience, slowly exploring your partner will drive her crazy.\n\nThink of sex like your favorite meal.\n\nWould you rather scarf it down or take your time and savor every bite? To give your partner an amazing orgasm, take your time and savor it. Start off by moving slowly and create a build-up of aching anticipation. Take off her clothes little by little and spend time kissing and touching each part of her body.\n\nIf you can manage to, leave her panties on as long as possible. Teasing her like this will increase the desire and make her want you even more.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve mastered being patient, spend some time exploring your partner. The Tantric Principle encourages the exploration of your partner and indulging in extensive foreplay. The principle expresses that, \u201cIf a woman\u2019s lover is willing to honor, love and worship her as a Goddess throughout her entire body before connecting with her genital area, she will yearn to open her legs for her lover\u201d. By exploring, it will help your partner feel comfortable and leave them anticipating the possibilities of what might come next.\n\nAs you move along her body, take note of what areas are sensitive and what she responds to most. Does she moan when you nibble at her inner thigh? Does a certain position cause her to lose all control? Try teasing her nipples with your tongue or hands as a way to massage and excite her.\n\nFeel free to check our educational YouTube playlist on 8 types of female orgasms. It will definitely make you feel like a sex professor!\n\nResearchers Komisaruk, Wise, Frangos, Liu, Allen, & Brody even discovered that arousing your partner by playing with her nipples is very similar to the arousal a woman feels when you play with her clitoris and vagina. By touching and teasing her body and exploring every inch, you\u2019re sure to bring her to an orgasm.\n\nWhile taking your time and exploring your partner more is all some women need to have an orgasm, adding toys to the mix can help a lot too. If this is new for you, start out by using a few basic vibrators and add to your collection as you become more confident with using them.\n\nRemember, good vibrations are the best vibrations.\n\nOther than vibrators, some women are aroused with the use of butt plugs or bondage ties. If they are comfortable with using these, it can significantly increase the likelihood of them having an intense orgasm.\n\nDoing the same thing in the same place can get boring. Change it up and move to different spots around the bedroom, the house, or, for the super adventurous, a place like a beach. Use your environment to increase excitement. The kitchen counter, for example, can be a fun place to play.\n\nOther than changing locations, playing sex games,\u00a0learning Yoni massage or using items you already have on hand can be a game changer. Using ice cubes and switching between warm and cold sensations will surely turn her on. Simply pop the ice cube into your mouth and glide it over her nipples, stomach, and down below.\n\nThe best thing you can do to help your partner orgasm is to talk to them about what they like. Are there any fantasies that they have? Is there a position that drives them crazy? Maybe you\u2019ll find out that you both really enjoy the same thing. Like bondage.\n\nWhen you\u2019re selfish and only focus on your own needs, giving your partner an orgasm will be unachievable. Communication is the best way to make them feel comfortable and confident in your intentions.\n\nIt lets your partner know that you care about making them feel good.\n\nGiving her an orgasm has a lot to do with making her feel comfortable. Biologist Justin R. Garcia found that, \u201c\u2026women were half as likely to orgasm from oral sex or intercourse during a casual hookup than when they were in a serious relationship.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, researchers found that, \u201cWomen likely do not feel comfortable telling their hookups what they want and need during sex while their male partners are admittedly less focused on pleasing a casual sex partner.\u201d This shows that making your partner feel comfortable will significantly increase the likelihood of them reaching an orgasm.\n\nNow that you have some tips in your toolbox, let\u2019s talk about what not to do. The most important thing to avoid is getting frustrated if the big \u201cO\u201d doesn\u2019t happen right away. Granted, it can be frustrating to feel like you\u2019re doing everything you can to pleasure your partner and not get the results you want right away.\n\nBut do your best to remember that some things take time and that\u2019s OK!\n\nSex is meant to be fun, relaxing and enjoyable for both partners. Be in the moment and savor it! And again, don\u2019t rush! Build up is half the battle. If you don\u2019t have your partner begging to ride you like Seabiscuit, it\u2019s going to be harder to make her hit the high notes.\n\nWhile these tips on how to make a woman orgasm do take some effort and time, the payoff is well worth it. Mixing and matchings these tips to suit what you both enjoy will create endless excitement in the bedroom for both of you.\n\nGiving your woman an amazing orgasm will not only keep her coming back for another ride but will increase your confidence in your abilities. End the cycle of second guessing if you rocked her world and know for sure.<|endoftext|>"}

When it comes to sexual pleasure, most of us crave a hard cock, ripe and ready to do the deed. But for some men, getting an erection and keeping an erection comes with a lot of pressure.\n\nA flaccid willy can be frustrating for both partners, especially if your male lover is struggling with a disorder called Erectile Dysfunction Disorder. But it is important to remember that ED is not the end of the world. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite.\n\nED is a very common issue in a relationship.\n\nDid you know that 1 in 4 men under the age of 40 struggles with ED? For some men, certain medical problems, from heart issues to diabetes to obesity, may lead to erectile dysfunction. For others, ED can simply be caused by emotional triggers. We will get into that later.\n\nEither way, if your man is struggling to get his trouser snake randy for a juicy session in the bedroom and are looking for ways on how to make a man with ED hard, I have just the inspiration. Read on to uncover fun and kinky ways on how to stimulate a man with erectile dysfunction.\n\nThe number one step you can take to please your man\u2019s limp member is to have empathy.\n\nIf he can\u2019t get hard, don\u2019t let negativity bring him down even more (pun intended).\n\nThe next time your male partner can\u2019t get it up, take a step back and tell him these three little words, \u201ctake your time\u201d. At the end of the day, there really is no hurry.\n\nOn the same token, never rush into sex or get freaky when you are both feeling overtired or anxious. This is a surefire way to not only kill the mood but his boner as well. Choose a time in the day when there is nothing else going on.\n\nAre you harboring all the good looks in your relationship?\n\nApparently, Scientists from Spain\u2019s University of Valencia have found that beautiful women can actually increase levels of cortisol in the male body.\n\nAnd since stress is the main contributor to erectile dysfunction disorder it makes sense that your beauty could trigger his banana to go from ripe to mush in minutes.\n\nAnd while I am not suggesting that throwing a paper bag over your head will solve all your problems, just make sure you are constantly stroking his ego too. To do this, consistently give him compliments, and by all means, go ahead and worship his cock.\n\nForeplay, especially kissing, licking and stroking are all delicious ways to heat things up.\n\nYou can also try using different moves on his package. Also remember to pay attention to his body language, remaining conscious of what strokes feel good for his manhood.\n\nIf his cock remains flaccid, don\u2019t fret just yet. The goal for foreplay is to make him feel loved and safe. If you want to satisfy a man with ED, tease him, stroke him and take your time. Once he gets it up, his cock will thank you. Yes, in more ways than one.\n\nSex with ED can be frustrating for both partners. But, since blood flow is one of the main reasons your man can\u2019t get it up, a cock-ring may help.\n\nCock-rings are a practical way to get more blood flow to your man\u2019s penis.\n\nYou can surprise your male lover with a cock-ring and treat them (and you) to a night full of thick and juicy erections. We like this assortment pack of cock-rings.\n\nOh, and one more thing. Make sure your man has already confided in you about his erectile dysfunction disorder before surprising him with a cock-ring. Randomly gifting your man a cock-ring could turn sour. That is if he isn\u2019t already aware of his problem and thinks you are undermining his ability to keep it up.\n\nMissionary or doggy, or any standing position will kill the vibe as well as his boner. That\u2019s because missionary, doggy or knee positions rely on the large muscle groups of his thighs and glutes which generate more blood to these muscles and effectively steals blood away from the penis. For better boners, switch things up.\n\nThe best sex position for your man with ED is to climb on top.\n\nBe it, cowgirl, reverse cowgirl or any position that involves your force. This will allow your man to relax which will help keep his cock nice and hard.\n\nWhen trying to satisfy a man who is suffering from ED, I encourage you to think outside the box. Or the cock?\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to also keep in mind that his inability to keep his cock hard most likely has nothing to do with you.\n\nSo, seriously don\u2019t get tripped up about worrying if you aren\u2019t pretty enough, good enough etc. Also, remember that ED is common. The best part about ED?\n\nIt actually gives you and your partner a chance to be even more creative with your sex life.<|endoftext|>"}

Too often, though, our natural lubrication is disrupted, and our sexuality can suffer.\n\nMany women know the discomfort \u2013 and even pain! \u2013 which can happen when the partner penetrates their yoni before it is fully lubricated. Most women use lube to avoid any discomfort. Fair enough. But is this truly the answer?\n\nPleasure is our birthright, and natural juiciness is a key factor for that pleasure. We want to share a powerful technique to increase your natural juices without any external help, but first, let us present the most common causes for a dry vagina:\n\nYou don\u2019t see yourself in one of these causes and suffer from dryness? Great. Bellow, we want to present you a simple technique with countless health benefits. One is\u00a0to increase your natural juiciness.\n\nThis article shows a variety of approaches that can help get your juices flowing again naturally. However, spoiler alert, the Taoist Yoni Egg practice works best for most women.\n\nThe ancient Chinese used beside herbs and acupuncture exercises to prevent and heal their body. They found that wild animals seemed to live in a state of everlasting health.\u00a0Three animals: the deer, the crane, and the turtle were known for their longevity. Of these three, the deer was noted to have the strongest sexual and reproductive abilities. Chinese healer developed a method they called \u201cDeer Exercise\u201d.\n\nIt gets its name because a deer in nature continuously stimulates its sexual glands by contracting and relaxing its anal muscles, and moving its tail, side to side.\n\nThe Deer Exercise is to be practiced every day without clothing\u00a0except the days of menstruation when you should skip it\u00a0to allow for smooth menstrual flow.\n\nIt contains two parts:\u00a0First,\u00a0a pleasurable circular massage of the breasts, and second, a pelvic exercise called\u00a0\u2018holding firm,\u2019\u00a0similar to a\u00a0kegel exercise.\n\na) Breast Massage\n\nSit in siddhasana, cross-legged or in a comfortable sitting position on a chair with a straight spine.\u00a0Lightly rub your breast in upward and outward circles. The hands travel together up the inside of the breasts toward the face, then outwards, downwards, inwards, and upwards again. \u00a0Lightly chafe the skin in circular motions with the nipples at the center of the circle. Do not hold the breasts and just move them \u2013 skim the surface of the skin.\u00a0We explained this technique (and other breast massage techniques) in-depth here.\n\nb) \u201cHolding Firm\u201d \u2013 the pelvic contraction.\nFirst, rest your hands in your lap. Form your hands into fists by encircling your thumbs in the other fingers. This activates a number of important acupressure points. Next, tighten the muscles of the vagina as though contracting it. Keep breathing in a deep, relaxed manner while holding the contraction as long as you comfortably can. You only need to do this step once after each 36-rotation breast massage.\n\nDuring the contraction, try to keep the anal sphincter and stomach muscles relaxed while squeezing and lifting only the vaginal muscles. You can learn to isolate the muscles by thinking of the muscles you use to stop urination in mid-stream. That\u2019s it! Not complicated, but powerful.\n\nIf you are working on your floral imbalance, it may take some time and patience to correct the dryness. There are some surprising causes of imbalance, and all sources need to be investigated and corrected.\n\nYou can easily buy vaginal lubricants in most pharmacies and supermarkets. To me, this says that too many women are ignoring the messages from their bodies and using an external method to force an outcome.\n\nBottom line: if our vagina is dry, then we are not ready for penetrative sex.\n\nObviously, if you are working through issues such as those listed above, you may temporarily use an artificial lubricant as part of the process. Here are our favorites:\n\nHowever, if you are generally in good health if it is very important to get in tune with your body, and develop real, natural juiciness, without relying on artificial lubricant.\n\nHow comfortable are you in exploring your body and pleasuring yourself? How willing are you to direct your partner in arousing and stimulating you? How assertive are you in making sure sex is happening in a way that works for you?\n\n1) Claim your foreplay\n\nTake as much time and touching as you need to become fully, deeply wet and ready. Most partners will savor the opportunity to feel your yoni dripping with anticipation before they enter you.  Founder Mariah Freya describes it like this:\n\nProlonging the time of love making will allow me to warm up my fine female pleasure body which takes me personally around 20-30 minutes. In that time I shed of stress, learn to bring my awareness to the present moment, and also acknowledge my partner properly.\n\n2) Drink enough water\n\nThere are tons of benefits by drinking enough water. One of them is your pussy being sweet and having that natural juiciness. Especially in the 2-3 hours before lovemaking.\n\n3) Squeeze (in all the right ways)\n\nStrengthening exercises such as Kegels\u00a0and Yoni Egg practice, stimulate the lubrication glands. Make sure you are doing the exercises correctly, so you don\u2019t accidentally send your pelvic floor into spasm!\n\n4) Become the deer\n\nPractice the Deer Exercise daily. This exercise is so powerful that some women have reported sailing through menopause without any discomfort at all. They only had symptoms such as dryness, hot flushes, and mood swings when they were out of their normal routine and didn\u2019t do the Deer Exercise for a few days in a row.\n\n5) Be brave \u2013 have regular sex\n\nDeep penetration massages the area around the cervix, stimulating the lubrication glands. Regular sex, which moves the cervix, will keep you deliciously juicy for the long term! Like our  Expert Maj Wismann said:\n\nBe honest and be brave. These are two things you should never ever stop practicing. In order to develop sexually, you need to be brave. Tiny, little steps are fine but these won\u2019t happen without the courage.<|endoftext|>"}

The outdated advice of writing the ABC\u2019s with the tongue makes me cringe. Let\u2019s be honest. Knowing how to please a woman is a skill that doesn\u2019t just happen overnight.\n\nIf you want to learn how to please a woman, think of it like a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nSo what\u2019s the secret? Well, it really boils down to an open mind sprinkled with a bit of sensitivity. Okay, maybe a lot of sensitivity.\n\nEither way, if you are ready to learn how to make a girl satisfied sexually, then read on to discover some fantastic tips on how to please your woman in and out of the bedroom.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, when it comes to your woman\u2019s emotions a little old-fashioned courtship can go a long way. Remember those old cheesy romantic comedies where the man would sit outside their lover\u2019s window with a guitar and a sappy ballad?\n\nYou see, when we are in the romantic early stages of a relationship, we are motivated to do all sorts of things to express our love and appreciation for our partner.\n\nWe say loving words. We shower them with gifts and acts of service. We can\u2019t wait to see them again. We touch. A lot.\n\nWandering where the flame has gone? Checking on your relationship\u2019s polarity\u00a0may be a good place to start. That is to say when boredom creeps into a relationship your sex life suffers. My advice? Buy her flowers, leave her love-notes on the refrigerator.\n\nRemember it\u2019s the little things that can help rekindle the fire.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are in a new relationship build-up slowly. There is nothing like the rush of holding hands and adolescent-like french kisses to keep the anticipation hot and stimulating.\n\nSexually pleasing your woman is important, and I promise, we will get to that later. Before lighting off the fireworks, however, it may be worthwhile to practice conscious listening.\u00a0Conscious listening is a simple technique to deepen intimacy in any relationship and to improve the communication between you and your partner.\n\nSound silly? It\u2019s not. Moreover, I can almost guarantee this exercise will help deepen intimacy between you and your current female lover. That\u2019s because dialogue between body parts can be a heartfelt way to make your female partner trust you.\n\nAnd, at the end of the day, a safe environment is crucial to helping your woman reach new depths of pleasure.\n\nAlong with courtship and conscious listening, there is that whole making her feel like she\u2019s really the only one for you. One of the biggest turn-offs for a woman may be when their man is ogling at other women.\n\nSo, if you are hankering to get busy between the sheets with your woman, stop chauvinistic behavior.\n\nThat includes resisting to turn your head when a pretty girl walks by in revealing clothing. Or even worse, flirting with her friends. Okay, so I am not asking you to put your sexuality in a straight-jacket. If you want to please your woman sexually, however, try to focus your attention on her.\n\nRemember when I said satisfying a woman is like a marathon, not a sprint? If you really want to sexually satisfy your woman, think with your heart, not with your manhood. \u00a0Ever heard of the nipple orgasm? For a woman, a nipple orgasm can produce a rousing orgasm when manipulated the right way.\n\nWant more tricks?

There are a few ways, but if you can nail down the following tips, you will be on your way to eating pussy like a master. The first secret to eating pussy like a pro is to find pleasure in giving her pleasure.\n\nStay attuned to your own stimulation while you are going down south on your female partner. Another secret to master the art form of eating pussy is to make sure she\u2019s down to get down.\n\nMeaning, make sure she feels comfortable with this type of oral sex.\n\nFinally, when you all up in her juicy love pedals, focus on her clit, but not too much! Use a steady stroking rhythm with the flat part of your tongue. You can also try using big circle movements with your tongue to stimulate the whole area. \u00a0For more tips check out:\u00a0What\u2019s The Best Way To Eat Pussy\n\nLove eating pussy?

It\u2019s an ancient Indian practice and is a great way to really spice up things up in the bedroom.

The solution?\n\nStart off with foreplay and focus on her pleasure instead of your own.\n\nThe second, even more common reason for uncontrolled ejaculation is when you fill up our pelvic area with sexual energy even without experiencing direct touch. A simple and surprisingly effective way to prevent this is to do some bonding activity with your female partner before sex.\n\nIt can be a practice as simple as a full body massage, maybe doing some yoga stretches if you\u2019re both into it, or even just a calm bath.\n\nWant more ideas on how to prevent premature ejaculation?

Does she hint at bringing things into the bedroom like whips or handcuffs? Perhaps she is craving a bit of BDSM. What\u2019s that you say?\n\nBDSM is an erotic combo of roleplaying that can include domination and submission, pain or sensation play, power exchange, leather sex, role-playing, and fetishes. If you have no idea where to start you can check out: BDSM for beginners.\n\nAlong with roleplaying, you can also experiment with introducing some fun adult toys.\n\nClassic dildos, vibrating bullets, and anal beads can all be a great way to get your freak on and make things a bit more interesting.

It has become a huge phenomenon in the West in the past 40 years. Unfortunately, the version of Tantra that has become super-popular these days is a watered-down version. Teachers who first started allowing Westerners to learn Tantra decided that Westerners were not ready for the whole truth, so they created a sort of Tantra-lite. Some would go so far as to call it Tantra Zero.\n\nTantra is a way of life, a spiritual path, but in the West, it is often reduced to a way of sex, and a sexual path. Tantric techniques in the West are sexual techniques. Tantric practice in the West is Tantric sexuality. \u201cTantra\u201d in the West is usually just Tantric sex. But there is so much more to Tantra!\n\nTable of ContentsWhat is Tantra in the West?So, what is Tantra, really?What is Tantric sex?What is a Tantrika?How to become TantricWhat is Tantric sexuality?How to practice Tantra and have Tantric sexHow to practice Tantra aloneHow to have a Tantric life\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn summary, the Tantric approach to life considers all aspects of the Universe to be Divine.\n\nThis puts Tantra in conflict with many religions, which separate the material world (profane, evil, dirty, and bad) from the spiritual world (pure, elevated, clean, and good). This is known as asceticism or the ascetic approach.\n\nAscetic traditions insist that people disconnect from the material world, from their bodies, their emotions, and their minds, in order to reach the Divine. Of course, all major religions have had their mystic sects, which disagreed with the ascetic approach. The Kabbalists in Judaism, the Gnostics in Christianity, and the Sufis in Islam have all sought God through embodied practices. These sects were often persecuted by the ascetic authorities.\n\nTantra belongs to the ancient Indian tradition, based in the Vedas. Tantra says that we are entirely composed of the Divine. Our bodies, emotions, and minds are manifestations of the Divine. We can reach the Divine by going deeply into any aspect of the material world, any sensation, emotion, or thought.\n\nAnd this is where sex comes into the Tantric picture.\n\nIn Tantra, any experience in the material world can become a gateway to the Divine. The more intense the experience, the greater its potential. Sex can be a very intense experience, and Tantric sexuality includes many techniques for making sex even more intense.\n\nThe purpose of Tantric lovemaking is not intense pleasure \u2013 although intense pleasure is usually a byproduct of Tantric sex!\n\nTantric techniques are designed to use sexual energy to reach altered states of consciousness.\n\nP.S. You might find this one principle of Tantric sex very intriguing and helpful.\n\nSomeone who practices Tantra is known as a Tantrika. Sometimes, the word is separated into Tantrik (for a man) and Tantrika (for a woman).\n\nTraditionally, you need to have a guru to learn how to practice Tantra and become a Tantrika. However, in the West, people have started calling themselves Tantrikas when they have learned Tantric techniques from books, or from short courses, or from teachers who didn\u2019t have an initiation into any Tantric lineage.\n\nTantra sounds like a lovely idea. I can be a good, moral person on a spiritual path and still enjoy lots of wild sex? Sign me up!\n\nIn practice, Tantra is a challenging path.\n\nOn an ascetic path, it is very straightforward \u2013 renounce the world, dry up all desires of any kind, and focus only on God. On the Tantric path, we stay engaged with worldly actions, desires, and emotions. It is much more difficult to keep the focus on higher things while still moving through day-to-day life.\n\nOnce we start to learn how to practice Tantra in the bedroom to enhance our sex lives, the intense experiences can become so fascinating and enjoyable that we forget there is any purpose to Tantric sexuality other than pleasure. Becoming lost in pleasure and forgetting the higher purpose is a trap, and is sometimes referred to as \u201cRed Tantra\u201d.\n\nWe become Tantric when we commit to living the whole of life as a spiritual practice. This is not the same as adopting a religion \u2013 there have been mystics who knew how to practice Tantra in every major religion, and there have also been agnostic Tantrikas.\n\nWe become Tantric when we decide there is something more to life than simply gratifying our physical, mental and emotional desires. When we start to seriously look beyond the ordinary, and seek the Divine in our everyday experiences.\n\nTantric sexuality is like Tantric swimming, Tantric taking out the garbage, or Tantric tying our shoelaces. Any aspect of life becomes Tantric when we bring our full attention, our full presence, and we actively look for the Divine in every moment.\n\nThere is something special about sex, though. (You might also find this one principle of Tantric sex very uplifting and helpful.)\n\nSexual union symbolizes the ultimate goal of Tantra \u2013 the union of opposites. Within each of us we have opposite poles \u2013 yin vs yang, receptive vs emissive, up vs down, yielding vs rigid, active vs passive, and so on. In order to reach higher states of consciousness, we need to transcend these apparent opposites. We need to understand that there is Yin within the Yang, and yang within the yin. We need to merge, or integrate, the apparent opposites, and understand that they are not actually in opposition to one another.\n\nWe each have an inner man and an inner woman, and these inner beings represent all these opposing pairs. When our inner man and inner woman merge in an inner sexual union, this represents the merging and integrating of all these opposing pairs.\n\nWhen we practice Tantric lovemaking with another person, one partner represents the Divine Masculine, and the other represents the Divine Feminine. When we come together in sexual union with another person, we are representing the inner union of our inner man and inner woman. Sexual union with another person represents the inner integration of all the things that appear to be opposed to one another.\n\nFor this reason, sexual union (either actual sex or a symbolic representation of sex) has been an important part of Tantric rituals. The shivalingam, still widely worshipped in temples throughout India and South-East Asia is a representation of this Divine sexual union of opposites.\n\nThe colonizing Europeans, particularly the British, completely missed the symbolic and spiritual aspects of Tantra, and focused instead on Tantric sexuality and the Tantric rejection of ascetic ideals of \u201cpurity\u201d. The British actually saw Tantra as a threat to British rule, because the Tantrikas refused to \u201cfollow the rules\u201d.\n\nTranslations of Tantric texts into English happened during Victorian times when anything sexual was titillating and shocking. Translators naturally focused on the literal, sexual meaning of the actions described in the texts, and overlooked the spiritual symbolism of the union of opposites.\n\nAs a result, the English-speaking public has been fed a hyper-sexual, spiritually impoverished form of Tantra. Only in the last decade have scholars started a widespread effort to go back to the original texts, and to make a more accurate translation. If you Google \u201cwhat is Tantra?\u201d you will immediately see the problem.\n\nThe definition of Tantra at the top of the page says (quite correctly) that Tantra is:\n\nAnd then you come to the search results:\n\n\u201cWe can guess what comes to your mind when we say \u2018tantric\u00a0sex\u2019: Sting. But the truth about\u00a0tantric\u00a0sex is a whole lot hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cInspired by the sexual success of these ancient love teachings (who wouldn\u2019t be?), Cosmo came up with a list of\u00a0tantric\u00a0sex positions to tempt, tease, then thoroughly please\u201d\n\n\u201cSex Advice: What is tantric sex?\u201d\n\nAnd so on \u2026\n\nThere is one useful link in the first page of results, and this is a good place to start investigating the historical background of Tantra in India.\u00a0You\u2019ll notice this is a website about spirituality, not about sex and relationships!\n\nNow, we are not saying that you can\u2019t have Tantric sex. Just that sex is not the most important part of learning how to practice Tantra. In fact, there are entire schools of Tantra in which physical sex is not part of the practice. There are known as \u201cright-hand\u201d Tantra. Sexual union is symbolized by the shivalingam, by flowers and fruit, and by visualization in meditation.\n\nHowever, the most famous form of the traditional Tantric ritual, the maithuna ritual, involves actual sexual union, so let\u2019s take a close look at how to have Tantric sex.\n\nThe most important aspect of Tantric sex is the spiritual context.\n\nEach person will find their own best way to establish a sacred space for Tantric lovemaking. Here are some suggestions:\n\nOnce you have created a good environment for Tantric sexuality, you can make love in any way you both enjoy.\n\nIdeally, when practicing Tantric sex, a man holds back from ejaculating. He will either not ejaculate at all, or he will wait until both partners have had at least half an hour of orgasmic consciousness before ejaculating. This allows the Tantric sex to raise the consciousness of both partners to higher states.\n\nThere are many Tantric techniques to help a man to hold off from ejaculating. These Tantric techniques will also give a man access to having non-ejaculatory full-body orgasms, and even multiple orgasms.\n\nThere are also Tantric techniques to help women achieve orgasm more easily. These Tantric techniques, including yoni massage, can make a woman\u2019s orgasms deeper and longer, and can also allow women to achieve multiple orgasms.\n\nOnce you have your sexual energy moving, the most important key to Tantric orgasm is to move the sexual energy out of the groin area and up the spine. Ultimately, the goal is to move all the sexual energy into the crown chakra, located about 20cm above the crown of the head.\n\nWhen you have put enough energy into the crown chakra, it will \u201copen\u201d, altering your state of consciousness. In the early stages of Tantric practice, this experience may be too intense to tolerate, and you may black out for a few seconds.\n\nAs you develop your capacity for bliss, you will be able to remain conscious as your crown chakra opens, and even to meditate during extended orgasms.\n\nWhen you feel you have had enough lovemaking, sit or lie in meditation. Observe the changes in your body, mind, and emotions as a result of your practice. Offer gratitude to your partner and to the Divine for this experience.\n\nThere is no requirement to have a partner in order to learn how to practice Tantra.\n\nWe all have an inner man and an inner woman, and we all have sexual energy we can raise, move, and take to our crown chakra.\n\nIt can be very useful to know how to practice Tantra alone, even when we have a partner available. For men, it can be easier to learn how to control ejaculation by practicing alone at first. For women, exploring our own bodies and understanding what gives us pleasure is an important part of preparing for practicing Tantra with a partner.\n\nWhen you practice Tantra alone, put just as much effort into setting the spiritual context as you would when practising with a partner.\n\nFor example, you could:\n\nOnce you have set the spiritual context, start to touch yourself. Switch your awareness between the hand, touching, and the body, receiving the touch. Notice how it feels to be the active party, and how it feels to be the receiver.\n\nGently explore your body, without rushing straight to the genitals. Find any spots which are particularly pleasurable. Pay attention to the sensations deep inside your abdomen, as well as sensations on the skin.\n\nAs you start to become aroused, you can pleasure yourself in whatever way you choose. If you find yourself getting close to ejaculation, pause for a moment and move all the energy out of your groin and into your heart or head.\n\nAs the sexual energy begins to flow, move it upward. Let it fill your whole being. Feel your inner man and inner woman merging together. Notice the energy shooting up your spine in the moments that their union is complete. Direct the energy to your crown chakra, about 20cm above the top of your head.\n\nWhen you feel you have had enough, allow your body to calm, and sit or lie in meditation. Observe the changes in your body, mind, and emotions as a result of your practice. Offer gratitude to the Divine for this experience.\n\nIf you bring a Tantric attitude to sex, but continue to move through the rest of your life in an unintentional, semi-hypnotized state, the benefits of your Tantric sexual practice will be limited. Tantra is a way of life, an attitude, a commitment to being awake and aware in every moment.\n\nYou may find it useful to support your Tantric sexuality with the other important aspects of Tantric practice \u2013 Tantric hatha yoga, Tantric meditation, and other Tantric techniques such as mantras and yantras.\n\nIn fact, it is very difficult for men to master their ejaculation reflex without the support of Tantric hatha yoga, and, in particular, Tantric techniques of sublimation. These include techniques such as uddiyana bandha, nauli kriya, and inverted asanas like the headstand and shoulder stand.\n\nLike anything else, the more you learn how to practice Tantra, the more you will get out of it!<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Ladies, This Is How to Suck a Dick Like a Sexy Vixen\n\n\n\nI still remember the first time I put a cock in my mouth. I was young, I was naive and I could have been sucking on a lollipop for all I cared. Oral sex is great until it\u2019s not. Meaning, robotic or erratic oral play can make things go south real fast. And not in a good way.\n\nBelieve it or not, there is way more to sucking dick than meets the mouth.\n\nThe things is, sucking dick is an art form.\n\nIt goes way beyond just a little in and out of the mouth. The reality is, sucking dick takes time and patience to perfect.\n\nSo, you want to learn how to suck a dick like a pro?\n\nThen read on to discover some mouthwatering dick sucking tips that will be sure to have your man toe-curled and screaming in ecstasy.\n\nWhether you love to suck dick or not (we will get more into that later) a yummy tasting cock is everything. Like the taste? We sure hope so! You can thank his pheromones for that. In fact, studies show that when you smell these pheromones, your lover will instantly seem sexier in your mind.\n\nDon\u2019t love the taste? Things like STDs can lead to a bad smelling cock, but many foul smells are due to sexual hygiene.\n\nIf you want to learn the best ways to suck dick and actually enjoy doing it, talk to your partner about \u201cfreshening up\u201d before your next dick sucking session.\n\nAsking your man to clean his manhood can get awkward and may even offend him. If you don\u2019t know how to approach the topic you can try and incorporate the following sexual hygiene techniques in a fun and sexy way:\n\nLure him into the shower or bath. Wash his cock with bubbles. Lather it up real good and start to stroke his member with a gentle handjob.\n\nUse a steamy (not too hot!) washcloth. Prep his cock with a warm washcloth and a mix of organic essential oils to \u201cprep his penis\u201d. Have him lay down and gently cuddle his penis with the washcloth. Move up and down in slow movements.\n\nYou can also ask him to \u201cprep\u201d his own penis. He can clean it however he desires, but make sure you tell him you would like it all nice and tasty because you are sooo hungry.\n\nNow that your man\u2019s cock is fresh and so clean, it\u2019s time to get to the good stuff.\n\nDon\u2019t love sucking dick? Truly, it\u2019s okay, but if you want your partner to enjoy your blowjobs you should too! If you can learn to love sucking dick it will make the experience so much more gratifying. Yes I know, it\u2019s called a blow \u201cjob\u201d but at the end of the day, sucking dick should not actually feel like a job. Love sucking dick? We love hearing that! Either way, you can always learn to love sucking dick even more.\n\nTo learn to love sucking your man\u2019s dick, try to imagine his cock as something holy. You know, like a shrine or a king that needs praising.\n\nYou can also try warming yourself up simultaneously while playing with your clitoris.\n\nFocus on your sensations and you can even try incorporating a dildo like this one while going to town on his penis.\n\nNeed more reasons to love sucking dick?\n\nDid you know that sucking dick actually has a number of health benefits? This is especially true if you swallow. Care for a little bit of Vitamin B12? You won\u2019t believe the mind-blowing nutritional benefits of a blowjob.\n\nIn fact, researchers have found that 95% of sperm is a mix of compounds that are incredibly good for you. A single sample of sperm contains a mix of Vitamin C, Vitamin B12, Lipids, Enzymes, and not to mention protein. I suppose there are other ways to get your daily dose of vitamins, but this way seems a bit more fun, no?\n\nYour man can have a wild oral orgasm only if he completely surrenders.\n\nThis means he has to know who is in charge.\n\nYou can start by setting a verbal intention before you go down on him.\u00a0It can be something like, \u201cI worship your cock\u201d or, \u201cI will do all the work, you just lay back and enjoy\u201d.\n\nAnother seductive practice to incorporate into a blowjob is called cock worship. Cock worship is about bowing down to his penis. Show him how much you love him and his penis and that he is the most beautiful man on earth. Certain strokes can also intensify the art of cock worship. We will touch (literally) on those a later on.\n\nWhatever intention you choose, make it clear that you are the giver and he is the receiver. This will relax him and assure him that you are there to give him everything he desires from the waist down.\n\nEver heard of the throat orgasm?\n\nWhile it may sound surreal the throat orgasm is indeed very accessible.\n\nAs mentioned before, if you can learn to honor both your partner\u2019s pleasure and your own pleasure at the same time you will suck a dick like a magician.\n\nWhile your partner\u2019s cock is the ultimate prize, you don\u2019t need a cock to get started. You can try practicing with a dildo to try and reach a throat orgasm.\n\nOnce you have some practice with the throat orgasm, you can move on to the real deal. To learn more about how to fire-up your throat and experience a mouth-watering orgasm check out this short video here:\n\nNo need to rush in for the goods. A good dick sucking session takes time and patience.\n\nIf you want to incorporate some awesome foreplay, you can try these exquisite Lingam Massage Strokes.\n\nLingam Massage is a beautiful form of cock worship. While the following techniques by themselves don\u2019t make up the complete practice of cock worship, these strokes can be a great way to get your man nice and turned-on before actually putting his cock in your mouth. For a more in-depth look at Cock Worship, make sure you check out our article on How-To-Give an Out-of-this-world Lingam Massage.\n\nStart from the root of the shaft. Gently press the penis with your thumbs and index fingers, and then release.\u00a0Move up about a centimeter and repeat the technique. Do this again until you\u2019ve worked your way up the entire length of the receiver\u2019s penis.\n\nYou can supercharge the pleasure your partner feels with this next move. Hold the sides of the Lingam with both of your hands and \u201cski\u201d with your thumbs by alternating up and down from the root of the penis all the way to the tip.\n\nThis stroke can provide the receiver with some interesting sensations. Surround the lingam with both hands and twist them in opposite directions. Keep a firm grip, but don\u2019t squeeze too hard here.\n\nNow, change up the tempo of the massage by slowing down and moving into a meditative moment. Circle the tip of your thumb and index finger in both directions around the frenulum of the penis, which is located just underneath the head\n\nWorship your lover by holding your hands with crossed fingers like you would in a gesture of prayer, and surround the penis between them. Then, you can open the thumbs and slide them along each side of the Lingam up and down at varying speeds.\n\nMost likely the strokes mentioned above will have him frothing, begging you to fill your mouth with his cock.\n\nThis is the perfect time to begin integrating the following dick sucking tips to take his blowjob to the next level\n\nGive light kisses from the scrotum up his shaft and all over his mushroom tip. Descend down from the tip, continuing with feather-like kisses until you reach his scrotum again.\n\nAlong with butterfly kisses you can also incorporate your tongue and some nibbles.\n\nKiss, nibble and lick starting where the balls meet the testicles. Move on to the shaft, up to the tip and back down again.\n\nFor many men, their most sensitive spot is their frenulum, this is where his shaft meets his mushroom tip.\n\nNow is the time you can suck his tip like a lollipop! Use suction to suck and smack your lips together. Put his entire tip into your mouth and suck mindfully and fully. Stop, when he has had too much.\n\nUse the same amount of suction you used for his frenulum and continue down his shaft. Suck sensually, slowly and rhythmically. Pucker your lips as you move down, suck and curl your lips on the way back up.\n\nOr see if you can. Depending on the size of your man\u2019s testicles, you may be able to get one or both in your mouth. Play with some suction, but watch out for teeth!\n\nThis is a particularly fetish way that may or may not get your man going. Spitting saliva on your man\u2019s tip can help to get it wet as well as show them who\u2019s boss. You. If your man likes a more dominant roleplay to get him going, spitting could work.\n\nWhen his cock fills your mouth, manoeuvre it to either fleshy side of your cheek. This will create an illusion that he\u2019s further inside your mouth.\n\nSucking a dick well doesn\u2019t always mean exclusive sucking. Feel free to add a hand or two during the process or incorporate any of the above-mentioned Strokes to make give your mouth a rest and make the blowjob that much more enjoyable.\n\nCheck your gag reflex. With some practice, deep throating can be incredibly satisfying for your man.\n\nStart by entering his penis slowly, gently moving it towards your Ulva (the fleshy part that hangs down from the back of your mouth). If you start to gag, back off and try again. This particular technique will take some time to get used to your own gag reflex.\n\nA little teeth can be erotic \u2013 a lot can be painful. So use caution when trying this technique.\n\nFill his cock in your mouth as much as you can covering the top and bottom teeth with your lips. Remove your lips to uncover your teeth and graze lightly up and down his shaft.\n\nEventually, I learned to lick a dick differently than a lollipop.\n\nIn other words, I realized that if I incorporate new moves into my dick sucking routine, I could keep my man\u2019s cock hard as a rock.\n\nSo, to add diversity while giving your man a blow job by integrating a few of the mouth techniques I listed above. Pair it with some sensuous Penis Strokes and it will turn a boring old blowjob into a super juicy session of cunnilingus in a matter of minutes.\n\nKeep in mind that while surprise is important when giving a blow job, consistency in stroking and sucking may lead to his final blow.\n\nAlso, always make sure to keep his balls in the playing field. They need love too. The lesson is \u2013 change things up but do it with integrity.\n\nThere is no point in lying. Mastering the art of sucking dick doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nBut, even if you don\u2019t feel like a cock-sucking master yet, your confidence is key to giving a seriously awesome night of lip service.\n\nMy advice? Be yourself.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel completely confident, you can try to \u201cfake it until you make it\u201d. That is, put his cock in your mouth and suck like you mean it.\n\nFurthermore, make sure you always communicate with your partner. Sucking dick is not one-sided.\u00a0Make sure you get his opinion on things (his likes and dislikes) as this will also help your dick-sucking confidence.\n\nWhen all said and done, practice makes perfect. When it comes to mastering dick sucking, treat your man to as many blow jobs as he likes.\n\nNeed some more ideas on how to build cock confidence? Try these integrating the following visualizations into your dick sucking session:\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s his cock in your mouth. If he has submitted to you, you are in charge now. Yes, of course, his needs matter too but, if you can visualize yourself as being the one in the \u201cdriver\u2019s seat\u201d, it may help you avoid feeling overly-vulnerable or detached.\n\nCommunicate, communicate, and then communicate some more! Cock confidence goes both ways. If your male partner assures you he will love you no matter what, dick sucking can be a whole lot more fun and with less pressure.\n\nRemember the throat orgasm? Why not practice the other strokes on a dildo as well? Or heck, a banana works too. While you definitely won\u2019t get the same reaction from a plastic dildo or a banana as you will from a real cock, it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt to do a test drive.\n\nA penis is a fun gadget of mother nature. Seriously, take some pressure off yourself and let go. Look at your lover\u2019s cock as a toy. Suck it, lick it, flick it, kiss it, yank it (not too hard) and just have fun. Once you take the pressure off yourself, your man will follow, and you are on your way to mastering the art form of sucking dick.\n\nHumming, moaning, and groaning can all lead to increased stimulation when giving a blowjob. Why not try all three at the same time? Is that even possible?\n\nJust like adding a diversity of strokes and sucks helps to make a blowjob more satisfying, so does a variety of sounds.\n\nTry alternating between deep humming to raspy moaning, and groaning. You will know you are doing it right if you feel a tickle in the back of your throat.\n\nAccording to Catriona Boffard, a credited clinical sexologist,\n\n\u201cA deep moan that originates from the back of your throat will not only give him auditory confirmation that you\u2019re also enjoying it, but it will create a certain sensation down his shaft too\u201d.\n\nUmm, sounds pretty glorious to me? And I am pretty certain you will make your man roar rowdy by adding a little more hum to your hummer.\n\nYour man\u2019s penis is exceptionally sensitive especially when he\u2019s about to blow.\n\nSo, if you feel that your man is about to reach the BIG O \u2013 go slow.\n\nYou can also decrease pressure and let your man surrender deeply into his orgasm.\n\nWhether he wants to cum in your mouth, between your breasts or knees, you may want to communicate before the session begins. That is, where he wants to cum.\n\nIf however, you want to add an element of surprise, try this dick sucking technique:\n\nAs he is about to ejaculate, stop sucking and keep your mouth over his cock.\n\nHe may try to pull your head away, don\u2019t let him. Your hot moist mouth is likely enough to maintain a sweet and steamy environment for him to experience a wild release of pleasure.\n\nKeep in mind that after your man reaches orgasm, the head of the penis can be particularly sensitive. If you touch it or suction it too hard, it can be very uncomfortable.\n\nAfter he orgasms, make sure you release the suction from your mouth gently. Move up from the penis with your lips only lightly grazing his shaft until his cock has completely left your mouth.\n\nWant to put the cherry on top of a blow job that is already proven to be out-of-this-world? Try looking up.\n\nMaking eye-contact while blowing your lovers cock is a great way to increase intimacy and stimulation.\n\nBy making direct eye-contact while sucking your partner off you\u2019re actually telling him you\u2019re in charge. This can help him to surrender even deeper into a puddle of ecstasy.\n\nTry kissing the tip while you look up at him and give him your sexiest gaze.\n\nIf he\u2019s not looking at you and simply moaning with pleasure, pay attention to his lusty groans and use them to guide your next move.\n\nFeel free to hold the gaze as long as you can. If it feels awkward, try looking down again.\n\nLet a few minutes past, and look up and try to lock eyes with him. While it can feel intimidating at first, it\u2019s an exceptionally seductive way to tune into your partner\u2019s desires.\n\nTo spit or swallow, that is the question.\n\nThe truth is, there is no right or wrong answer.\n\nIf you choose to spit, you are going to have to dispose of it somehow. Make sure you have a tissue nearby, or if you want, you can swish it around your mouth for a bit until you excuse yourself to the bathroom.\n\nAlso note, if you choose to spit, it is beneficial to have a conversation with your man as to why you are spitting.\n\nRunning to the bathroom or a trashcan after a blowjob can be awkward and offensive.\n\nSwallowing, on the other hand, can be wildly romantic and sexy especially if you\u2019re really into the guy.\n\nIn fact, studies show that semen can actually boost your mood. That\u2019s because the biochemical composition of male semen and its nutritional value share similar substances to anti-depression medication.\n\nWhether you choose to spit or swallow is up to you. Either way, try to make the disposal of his semen as sexy as possible, this will help keep the mood smooth, hot and sensual.\n\nAs you can see, sucking dick is more than just a little in and out.\n\nIt takes time, practice, poise and perhaps even a little submission to become a dick sucking wizard.\n\nIf you really want to suck a dick like the sexy vixen you are, you now have the skills. Now, it\u2019s up to you to own them.\n\nSo go ahead \u2013 and give your man that blowjob he\u2019s been waiting for \u2013 it\u2019s time to suck your man\u2019s penis like he\u2019s never been sucked before.<|endoftext|>"}

You can thank us later.\n\nMany of us experience problems in the bedroom, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should just give up or drop your partner because of it!\n\nYou may have found yourself in a long term relationship where the sex has become disconnected, boring, or non-existent. Or, perhaps you\u2019re in a new relationship and you\u2019ve encountered issues with techniques or mismatched libidos.\n\nAll of these are very common themes when it comes to sex, so just remember\u2013\u2013you\u2019re not alone!\n\nOnce you discover how to talk about sex with your partner, it can really help to alleviate any pressing sexual concerns.

Discover 50+ penis & vagina massage techniques (including self-massage).\n\nCommunication is key before, during, and after your sexual encounters. Initially bringing it up as a topic to discuss could be done via text, phone or in person. But picking the right time of day can make all the difference when you are figuring out how to talk about sex with your partner.\n\nIdeally, don\u2019t bring it up when tensions could be running high. Say, at work or just after work. Even late at night when you and your partner are tired and irritability levels are high. This could risk your partner feeling criticized or defensive about their performance.\n\nAt the right moment when you feel safe and comfortable, calmly suggest to your partner that you\u2019d like to talk about sex with them. You could then set a time, and a timer, and make a judgement-free space. You can even suggest regular check-ins.\n\nIf you feel like making it special, you could make it a cozy atmosphere by adding some candles, pillows, and some nice music.\n\nIt can feel quite daunting, but rest assured, you will feel relieved and grateful that you did! It\u2019s a brave thing to do, but our task ahead is to normalize the conversation in your relationship, so it will become easier in the long run.\n\nBefore you sit down and have a conversation with your partner, it is worth taking a moment to reflect on what exactly it is that you want to discuss. Invite your partner to do the same. Reflect on what you enjoy about sex, what you don\u2019t, and some points for improvement.\n\nThis practice encourages you to let go of fear by free writing whatever comes to your mind about sex. Set a timer for 3 minutes, and if you feel comfortable enough you can share and discuss.\n\nSitting opposite each other in your cozy space, spend 2 minutes looking into each other\u2019s eyes. This exercise results in a deep connection and a trustful relationship.\n\nEye gazing is so powerful that studies have found it can produce passionate feelings between strangers.\n\nOnce the two minutes are up, set up two more minutes per person dedicated to Conscious Listening. Take this time to share your feelings about your sex life, and not just hear the words that each of you are saying. Listen to the true message being communicated.\n\nTake active listening to a whole new level by adding a structured layout to it. Spend a minute or two per person to freely answer the following questions:\n\nThe active listener can only reply \u201cthank you, what else do you fear, love, or desire?\u201d. Use this audio guide to follow along.\n\nPerhaps you have a specific fantasy that you are struggling to bring up in conversation. One easy method to test the waters is saying to your partner \u201cI had a dream that we did XYZ.\u201d Sense their reaction. You may be met with some resistance, humor, or even desire, in any case you can develop the conversation further with a playful curiosity.\n\nA great visual tool for sexual communication is the Graphic Sex Project. Via this online tool, you and your partner can prepare and compare your graphs. Picking from topics such as: a typical sexual encounter that I like, a typical sexual encounter that I don\u2019t like, a fantasy, how I like/don\u2019t like to have sex.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve shared your graphs, you can analyze and learn about each other\u2019s preferences and hard limits!\n\nIf you\u2019re keen to try a certain position or kink out, it might be worth exploring pornography together. You can discuss each other\u2019s likes and dislikes when it comes to watching sex compared to having sex. For many of us, our porn and fantasies aren\u2019t reflective of what we want in the bedroom with our partner, but it can be a fun insight into each other\u2019s desires.\n\nAccepting that neither you nor your partner knows everything about sex is a great step for opening the doors to curiosity. Introducing \u2019s Yoni Massage course into your relationship will definitely give you something to talk about.\n\nIn the course, you can both learn new techniques and forms of pleasure. Read or follow along to the videos, making sure to check-in \u201cdoes this feel good?\u201d throughout.\n\nEqually as fun, is the  Lingam Massage course. You can also practice these on yourself in your own time and teach your partner what you\u2019ve learned by discussing the process and how you felt.\n\nIn the BDSM and Kink scene, it is common to use safe words during sex. You can discuss what words you\u2019d like to use before you have sex. For inspiration, the most popular safe words are Pineapple and Banana.\n\nIt is important to use this when there is something you aren\u2019t enjoying and you want to stop having sex or re-evaluate your positions.\n\nThe traffic light system is typically used to indicate whether you want more of the same thing (green), maybe try something different (yellow), and I want to stop altogether (red).

But to give your guy pleasure like he\u2019s never had, you need to satisfy his brain as well as his body.\n\nGuys need about 20 minutes of foreplay to get them in the mood, so there\u2019s plenty of time to play around before getting to the main event.\n\nAnd the more you mix it up, the harder you\u2019re both going to cum.\n\nA study by the University of Indiana found 89 percent of women who performed five sex acts on their man had a harder orgasm themselves.\n\nLet\u2019s find out how.\n\nYes girls, let\u2019s use our mouths in a different way to turn your guy on in the bedroom. Try thinking about crazy, kinky things you\u2019ve wanted to do to him\u2026 and then tell him every last detail.\n\nAsk him what he wants, too.\n\nWe guarantee dropping the \u201cif I allowed you to do anything to me what would you do?\u201d bomb into the conversation will only end well (for both of you!)\n\nIf you\u2019re a little shy and think dirty talk isn\u2019t for you, think again. What about trying \u201cpolite\u201d dirty talk, instead?\n\nInstead of telling him exactly how you\u2019re planning on getting him off, try teasing him. Telling your guy that when he gets home from work, he\u2019ll have a surprise waiting for him can be just as sexy as the most R-rated dirty talk!\n\nA lot of guys just want to be dominated, so taking the lead during sex can be a massive turn on for them.\n\nIf your guy is the one that\u2019s always suggesting sex, something small like initiating foreplay can be a major turn on for him.\n\nBut how about taking the lead and deciding what you\u2019re going to be doing, too? Try telling him what you want him to do and when you want him to do it.\n\nThis will surprise him and let him know that you\u2019re going to be the boss for the evening.\n\nEverybody has a fetish, whether they admit it or not. So what are your guy\u2019s dream fetishes? If you don\u2019t already know, don\u2019t panic. It may take him a while to let you in on what they are.\n\nInstead of just dropping it on him and asking him about them, talk about your fetishes instead.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to give BDSM a try or thought about having racy anal sex in the shower\u2026 Tell him! If he\u2019s a closed book and still won\u2019t open up about his fetishes, try and guess them!\n\nTease him about him wanting to see you with another girl, or mention to him in passing about having sex in public. Once you uncover what he\u2019s really been thinking and wanting, then you\u2019ll be able to satisfy his deepest desires.\n\nStop playing safe. Instead, mix up your boring bedroom routine and have sex somewhere else in your house. This is why having sex on holiday feels so\u2026. damn\u2026. good. Because you\u2019re getting away from your normal routine!\n\nTry playing with your guy somewhere new like your kitchen or bathroom.\n\nSurprise him when he\u2019s in the shower and invite yourself in. Or spice up your evening meal by testing out the kitchen counter. If you\u2019re really feeling the urge, take him out to the garage and test out the car bonnet!\n\nInstead of getting upset that your man is watching porn, why not offer to join him? You can find out what he likes and you might find he likes something super sexy that you\u2019ve never tried.\n\nThink of it as an education: take one of his favorite scenes from a porno and copy it yourselves.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing your guy will love more than being the star of his very own porn film! Just make sure you turn the porn off before starting so your lines won\u2019t get crossed.\n\nSomehow, somewhere\u2026 an urban myth started that said women don\u2019t enjoy giving men head. If you\u2019re looking for a way to really turn your guy on, showing you\u2019re into giving him head is at the top of the list.\n\nGuys love a good visual, so try looking at him next time you give him head.\n\nThrow in some moaning to show him you\u2019re enjoying it as much as he is as well. Try adding little kisses and licks over his whole body and let your hands go wandering\u2026 it\u2019ll make your blowjob something he\u2019ll dream about.\n\nBut most of all\u2026 be confident!\n\nThe best blowjobs are the ones where you know what you\u2019re doing\u2026 so if you\u2019re looking for some tips, we\u2019ve got them here.\n\nOkay, this one is a little bit naughty. But there\u2019s nothing that will turn your guy on more than letting him watch you pleasure yourself. Nothing.\n\nA good way to slip this on into your foreplay is to stop everything when things are heating up and start to touch yourself.\n\nDon\u2019t let him touch you, either. Set a time limit (say 20 or 30 seconds) when he has to sit and do nothing but watch you.\n\nNot only will this drive him crazy, but it will have him gasping for the time limit to be over so he can touch you again!\n\nThis can also work wonders for you too; touching yourself in front of him is a subtle way of letting him know which parts you love him to touch, and how.\n\nYour guys\u2019 testicles are one of his most sensitive parts, so use it to your advantage. Playing with his testis will drive him nuts, literally.\n\nTugging and stroking them during sex is not only a fun way of letting him know that you aren\u2019t ignoring his man bits, but it\u2019ll also increase the intensity of his orgasm.\n\nYou can play with them in other ways, too. Putting his testis in your mouth and gently sucking them will surprise him and send pleasure waves across his body. Word to the wise: his testis will bruise easily, so ladies\u2026 no squeezing or biting!\n\nHow many times have you tried to find your man\u2019s G-spot? Yeah, we thought so. The prostate is known as the male g-spot, and if you\u2019re looking for a way for your man to be sexually addicted to you\u2026 this is it.\n\nTo find his g-spot (and the most intense orgasm of his life) you need to use the back door. It\u2019s about 5cm inside his anus, and we recommend lubing up before attempting to gain entry. Once you\u2019re in, communication is key here.\n\nEvery guy is different; some like it really slow, some don\u2019t.\n\nSome like you to stimulate their penis and prostate at the same time, and some guys want you to just focus on one thing. The only way for you to find out what\u2019s best is to ask your guy what he likes and what he wants you to do.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to get too friendly, you can buy finger condoms to put on your fingers as well. If this wakes your interest check our Prostata Massage Guide.\n\nGet The Blindfold Out\n\nDrive him crazy by not letting him know where your next move will be. Not knowing when or where you are going to lick, kiss or suck him will drive him crazy!\n\nTie Him Up\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need fluffy handcuffs to make tying him up fun. Just use a scarf or anything you have laying around.\nAnd don\u2019t tie him up to the bed\u2014use it to tie up his penis and testicles.\n\nTie a large knot at the top base of his manhood, and leave enough fabric either side for you to grab onto. This will give you a fun way to play with the pressure of the knot while you\u2019re riding him!\n\nShare a Vibrator\n\nHave you always had more fun with toys when you\u2019ve had someone to play with? Try using a vibrator together to really get him going. You can either use it yourself and let him watch, or get him to pleasure you with it.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s going to turn him on.\n\nTurning a guy on doesn\u2019t have to always be dirty and kinky. There\u2019s always room to really get his blood pumping. Saucy sex in the kitchen, showing his g-spot some attention and tending to his testis are all ways to drive your man crazy.\n\nGet excited. Because with these tips, your boyfriend is about to become sexually addicted to you.<|endoftext|>"}

These balls assist in strengthening your pelvic floor, an area that is so often overlooked when it comes to exercise.\n\nWith 15 minutes a day, you can have longer, stronger orgasms and avoid some serious health issues too. Sound good? Yeah, it does!\n\nThis is actually a very common question as many women go through life without giving them much thought. Or, not until they need to at least. Kegels is actually the term given to the exercises that we complete to strengthen our\u00a0pelvic floor or PC muscles.\n\nOur pelvic floor consists of a group of interweaving muscles that support our bladder, uterus, rectum and small intestine. These muscles work like a sling to keep everything in place inside our bodies. Both women and\u00a0men have PC muscles but Kegel balls are designed for female use so don\u2019t go sticking them up your butt\u2019s boys.\n\nThere are other toys for that! The term Kegels is named after the American gynaecologist Arnold Kegel who created the Kegel perineometer. This tool measures voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor, so both the exercise and the balls are named after him.\n\nThis group of muscles sits low in your pelvis and they are the same muscles that you clench to stop urination midstream. The \u201cpee stoppers\u201d as I lovingly call them.\n\nThe easiest\u00a0way to find them is to practice while you are going pee and use your muscles to stop the flow. That\u2019s them! Start by trying while you pee once or twice then, trying to locate and clench those same muscles when you are sitting or standing.\n\nAnd keep in mind that you need to clench the PC muscles only. It\u2019s easy to clench your booty or thigh muscles instead. Yes, they are important too. But this is all about the Kegels.\n\nOh, you mean other than holding our vital organs in place? Our\u00a0pelvic floor health is extremely important as weakened PC muscles can cause all sorts of issues in female bodies.\n\nAs we age these muscles tend to loosen but things like pregnancy, childbirth and being overweight can all weaken these muscles too. A weakened pelvic floor can result in prolapse of these muscles or incontinence.\n\nFrom a little dribble when you sneeze to the organs literally falling into your vagina in more serious cases. Have I got your attention now?\n\nAnd I mean, seriously easy. In fact, you don\u2019t even need Kegel balls to start with. You can literally exercise these muscles anytime and anywhere without anyone knowing about it. You clench the muscles yourself and hold.\n\nHere are a few simple exercises to get you started.\n\nThis exercise is literally as simple as the name suggests. You clench and squeeze the muscles for 2 seconds, then release for 2 seconds and keep repeating this for five minutes. Easy-peasy right?\n\nThe important thing here is to make sure you are only clenching the PC muscles and nothing else.\n\nIf you feel like you are starting to clench your booty or thighs, relax, loosen your body and re-start. It takes a few tries to get it right. And don\u2019t forget to breathe! It sounds easy but after a little while, you will start to feel it!\n\nAnother exercise is to clench the PC muscles and hold the squeeze for as long as you can. If you feel it loosening, then tighten up and continue until your muscles are completely worn out. Trust me, you will definitely feel this one so don\u2019t forget to breathe!\n\nWhile exercising with these two exercises will help to strengthen these muscles, if you want to fast-track the process, you can\u00a0introduce a set of Kegel balls. This will make your progress a whole lot faster and make your muscles even stronger. Its all about upping the ante!\n\nSo what exactly are Kegel balls you ask? They are just\u00a0weights for your vagina. They can come as one single ball or two balls and can be attached with silicone or string, or they can be inserted separately like benwa balls.\n\nNo matter which style you go for, they will all be slightly weighted and are designed to be held in place inside your vagina.\n\nNow, this may sound a little scary, but Kegel balls have actually been around for centuries in one form or another. They were first introduced in Ancient China in the form of jade eggs and they have been used by women ever since, so they must be doing something right!\n\nHow could I forget?! As well as all the other benefits, one of the best things about strengthening your Kegels is that it directly impacts the\u00a0strength of your orgasm.\n\nYup, the stronger your PC muscles are the more blood flow that is sent to your pelvic region resulting in stronger contractions when you\u00a0orgasm.\n\nHello, amazing orgasms! And, increased blood flow to the PC muscles also means increased blood flow to your vagina. This makes your body more sensitive and responsive and\u00a0increases your libido. Um, yes, please.\n\nThe best thing is that Kegel balls can be used by literally any woman and they work wonders as both a preventative measure to avoid issues in the future. They also work to heal those whose muscles have already loosened.\n\nThey are especially recommended for\u00a0women that have already had children.\n\nOr of course, anyone that suffers from\u00a0incontinence. There are different sizes and weights dependent on your age and whether you have had children or not too so you don\u2019t need to worry about the falls feeling out or struggling too much to hold them in place. Just make sure you find a set that will work best for your body.\n\nKegel balls are super easy to use but there are a few things you can do to make the process a whole lot more enjoyable too. Before you start, make sure you and your body are ready to put them in. Have a shower or massage your breasts to activate your natural lubrication. Don\u2019t pop them in if you\u2019re not feeling ready for it.\n\nPrepare your body and your mind and make sure you have a \u201cYes\u201d from your vagina.\n\nMake sure they are clean first by washing them with warm water and a high-quality sex toy cleaner or mild soap so they are safe for your body, then lubricate them with a bit of water-based lubricant. But don\u2019t over-do it or they will become too slippery to hold and will be difficult to insert.\n\nThen, prepare your body as we talked about earlier, relax as much as you can and pop them in as you would a tampon.\n\nIf struggling, pop one leg up on the bed or a chair or you may need to lie down to get them in properly. It can be a bit tricky at first but just find the position that suits you best. Once they are in comfortably your\u00a0muscles will naturally contract around them.\n\nSo how to use Kegel balls now that they are in? There are passive ways to use them and there are more active options too. To start out with, you can go about your business. You can walk about, watch TV, even do some light exercise and keep them in place.\n\nYour body will do the work for you to hold them up.\n\nIf you are brave, you can head out for a walk down the street with them in and get a little naughty with it. No one will know but you. Or, if you want to try something that is more active and will work you a little harder, you can try one of these exercises.\n\nThe glute bridge is a great exercise to strengthen and lift your booty, and it can activate your pelvic floor muscles too, especially when you have Kegel balls in. To perform the glute bridge you need to start on your back with your spine pressed flat against the ground and your knees bent at a 90-degree angle.\n\nYour feet need to be flat against the ground and your arms will be down at your side with palms facing down. As you inhale, push up through your heels to raise your hips off the ground. As you do this, squeeze your glutes, hamstrings and pelvic floor so that your body is in a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.\n\nPause for 1-2 seconds at the top, then return to the starting position. Ideally, you want to complete about 10-15 reps and 2-3 sets of the exercise with a little break of 30 seconds in between each set.\n\nThe table top is a classic Pilates move that takes things a set further to engage your pelvic floor muscles too. Oh, and you get a cheeky ab workout. You\u2019re welcome!\n\nStart with your back on the floor and your knees bent up in the air with your thighs perpendicular to the floor and your shins parallel to the floor. Keep your spine as flat to the floor as possible and your thighs touching.\n\nWith control, slowly split your legs open so each knee falls outward. Don\u2019t push too hard and allow your knees to fall to a comfortable position. Then, move them back together to the starting position. Try 3 sets with 10-15 reps each.\n\nIf you are up for a challenge to keep those balls in place, then this is the exercise for you.\n\nStart standing in an upright position with your feet just wider than shoulder width apart and your toes pointed outward. Then bend your knees and push your booty and hips back as though you are about to sit down in a chair.\n\nDrop your body down until your thighs are parallel with the ground. Make sure your weight is in your heels and your knees are bowed outward slightly in line with your toes.\n\nThen straighten your legs and return to an upright position squeezing your booty together at the top. This one requires 1 set of 15 reps as it is a bit more challenging than the last two.\n\nWhen you want to remove the balls, ensure your hands are clean and slowly pull them out by the cord if they have one, or with your fingers. And don\u2019t worry, they can\u2019t get lost because there is nowhere they can go. If you are struggling, you can also use the PC muscles to try and lightly push them out.\n\nRelax and breathe and you will get them!\n\nIdeally, you want to use the balls for\u00a015 minutes every day. And if you can\u2019t manage that, then at least as often as possible. And make sure you don\u2019t overdo it and leave them in for too long. Think of your PC muscles as you would any other muscle of your body.\n\nIf you work them too hard, you can do more damage than good.\n\n15 minutes is the perfect amount of time to work those bad boys without wearing them out too much.\u00a0 Remember that strengthening your PC muscles and pelvic floor with Kegel balls is a marathon, not a sprint and it will take about 3 weeks before you start to notice a difference.\n\nIf you struggle to keep them in for the full amount of time at first, then you likely have a set that is too heavy or too small for your body. You could try going with a shorter time to start with or you could start with a larger set and work your way towards the smaller ones when you feel stronger.\n\nA strong healthy body and the best sex of your life takes work after all!<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Pussy Love: How to Give Yourself a Delicious Labia Massage\n\n\n\nOur labia tend to get a bit of a rough deal. We constantly worry about how they look and compare them to other women we see in photos or in films.\n\nAnd, when it comes to playtime they barely get a look in.\n\nIf they are lucky, they will get a very short stroke as they spread apart and then, they are pretty much forgotten. For most of us, our labia play the supporting actress in our sex lives while the clitoris and the g-spot get the starring roles. But, not any longer.\n\nThe new year is about self-care and I\u2019m starting with labia massage.\n\nThe thing is, our labia are actually full of nerve endings and are connected to the same neural system that lets you feel pleasure throughout your entire pelvic area.\n\nPlus, increased blood flow to the labia means increased blood flow to the whole genitalia. This increase results in everywhere else being more sensitive and receptive to sensation too. Plus, getting to know our bodies has so many benefits.\n\nAccording to research scientist Debby Herbenick, the more positive view we have of our genitals, the more likely we are to experience pleasure, the more likely we are to orgasm and the more likely we are to be experimental in bed.\n\nUm, it\u2019s a yes from me to all three. Hello, labia massage!\n\nYou can use a high-quality water-based lubricant \u2013 the fewer chemicals the better of course.\n\nOr, you can use your favorite oil so long as it is safe for internal use. Although we are focusing on the vulva, it\u2019s likely that there will be some liquid heading for your vagina too, so its best to be safe!\n\nAnd most importantly, yourself!\n\nBeing freshly showered, warm, relaxed and happy will definitely help with the process too.\n\nAnd, if that doesn\u2019t cut it, check out this full run-down of how to get yourself ready for some self-love here.\n\nKeep in mind while you rub, that the outcome here isn\u2019t necessarily orgasm.\n\nIf you do reach it, awesome! And if you don\u2019t, also awesome!! Orgasm isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all of female pleasure.\n\nSufficient slipperiness is essential for a good massage. Don\u2019t just squeeze it messily out of the bottle though!\n\nApplying the lubricant or oil is all part of the experience.\n\nApply it generously over the hands and vulva and make sure you fully coat the labia majora and the labia minora. Ensure that you don\u2019t go overboard with this though as it may actually reduce sensation if there is too much. Apply it slowly until you find that sweet spot!\n\nNow, let\u2019s wake the girl up a bit.\n\nStart by lightly tapping all over the external vulva area, including your vaginal mound. This should help to sensitise the area and get those nerve endings fired up. Try out tapping with a different heaviness of the fingers. Find out how you like it best. Soft, firm, or a bit of both.\n\nThat slipperiness will really come in handy for Pussy Petting.\n\nMake sure your hands are completely coated and slide your full hand from the top of the pubic mound all the way down to the perineum, and then repeat with the other hand.\n\nRepeat till you purr.\n\nCup the vulva with your hand, apply a light amount of pressure and gently move your hand slightly around in circles. This will inadvertently stimulate the clitoris too. They are all connected after all!\n\nSkin Rolling is about really waking up the nerve endings.\n\nGrab the skin lightly and roll it between your fingers. You can perform this on both the labia majora and the labia minora. Try utilizing different pressures to see how they feel for you.\n\nMove your index fingers up and down the labia with long slow strokes. Go from the top of the clitoris down to the bottom of the perineum and back up again.\n\nYou can use two fingers at one or alternate your fingers one at a time to really tease the skin.\n\nThis moves requires a super light snapping of the skin with your fingers. Make sure it is always a gliding movement not an actual snap though\u2026 Ouch.\n\nLightly pull the skin up and let it go again. We are after large flowing motions here folks.\n\nUse the fronts of your index fingers to rest against the labia on either side of the clitoris. Apply pressure and lightly move the fingers up and down. This will apply pressure to the clitoris and you guessed it! Feel freaking amazing.\n\nUse one hand to lightly push the pubic mound up towards the belly to open up the vulva. With the other hand, trace a circle between the inner and outer labia from the perineum to the clitoris. You can up the ante with a clitoris loop too.\n\nLastly, the Breath of Spring. Gently part the labia and blow air on it. That\u2019s it. Simple, yet effective. There is no set order for the perfect labia massage, and how many times you repeat each technique is up to you. Pleasure is personal and if you like something, you can keep doing it.\n\nAnd, if something doesn\u2019t feel good, don\u2019t do it. Easy.\n\nThere are also no rules for how long this massage should last in total. It\u2019s all about listening to your own body and going for as long as you are comfortable with. It might last for 10 minutes or it might last for 2 hours.\n\nI tend to take a lot of time to fully relax my body and get into the groove, so ten minutes for me would only be the warmup! This is all about relaxing, exploring and keeping our nerve endings feeling electric. Let\u2019s learn to love and appreciate our labia and make our vulvas feel as special and as necessary as our other favorite body parts.\n\nFeeling inspired?

Curious how to take your sexual experience to the next level, make love on the 7 chakras and raise your erotic consciousness in the process?\n\nYou came to the right place.\n\nThe Tantric yogis realized in a time no one exactly knows when (but quite some thousand years ago), that sex with awareness can lead to their ultimate goal: experiencing \u201cOneness\u201d with existence.\n\nHow did they realize that? Tantric Sex, again, meaning \u201csex with awareness\u201d can build up a lot of energy. Kundalini energy to be specific. Building up a similar amount through meditation and yoga practice would take years. This energy is then skilfully blasted through each and every single Chakra (energy center) which purifies and opens them up to clear the pathway for Kundalini.\n\nThe goal in this process is to have all Chakras purified and open so that Kundalini can move up the body like a snake that uncoils, from the root or base of the body all the way up to the crown chakra.\n\nThe first rule is: \u201cWhere the mind goes the energy flows\u201d. This is a very common saying in the Yoga world. Bringing your focus to a Chakra and meditating on it while you are making love, you are doing the first crucial step to purify and grow your consciousness on this level.\n\nBut to make this a full Tantric sexual practice we need to add an extra element \u2013 embodiment.\n\nWhen you embody, express and play out what each Chakra is made of, you tap into the full potential. Each Chakra has a core and attached element (especially the first 5 \u2013 after that it gets more metaphysical and subtle).\n\nWhen we try to go entirely into this essence from the physical level (positions), to the emotional (what you are expressing) and psychological level (your focus) we can experience this Chakra fully inside of our being (not just on the mental, meditative level). This way you can experience this Chakra and open up towards it.\n\nThis explanation may sound a little esoteric and cryptic to you. Let me show you how you can make love on all seven chakras. And in the process purify and open up each and every single one of them, so that your Kundalini snake can uncoil beautifully.\n\nWhen you make love on the root chakra you tap into your most vital being; you tap into your body. The root chakra connects with the earth, with vital earth energy. It all starts here. Bring your awareness to your perineum and imagine you are moving into your primal being, of your wild nature.\n\nLet go of your survival mode, of your fear that you may be losing control. Focus on your trust.\n\nSex on this chakra is raw.\n\nImagine you are living in a tribal environment, you believe in your instinct, you have a lot of energy. Express that in your bedroom. Touch each other firmly, squeeze each other\u2019s bodies. Have strong, powerful sex. Be wild be bold and don\u2019t care what others may think of you. Opening the root chakra means deciding to be inside your body while you make love, be in the now.\n\nAnal sex can be scary for many people, but it can create a lot of healing on this level. But that\u2019s of course not the only way\u2026 It has a lot to do with trust and stepping into our primal instincts. Think of sex in nature, sex on the beach on the bare ground. How would an Amazonian make love?\n\nFood for thought: Create a trustful and safe environment for yourself and your partner so that you are both able to fully let go. What kind of bedroom or space do you need to be in to go there? What setting do you need to allow yourself to moan loud like an animal? What\u2019s needed that you can be loud and wild, that you can rock your bed through the room like a strong, vital animal?\n\nElement: Earth\nFocal point: Perineum a few centimeters outside the body\nBest position: Anvil Sex Position (Receiver lies on the back with the legs up in the air leaning on the shoulders of the giver.)\nSense: Hearing (ears)\n\nHaving Sex on the sacral chakra, your sexual center, means you step into a hot movie, a movie that you are about to create. Focus on your sacral chakra, on your creation, your creativity. This center delivers the very essence of who you are as an authentic sexual being.\n\nMany people discover blockages on this level because it may bring up negative beliefs that we accumulated on sex over the years. It may bring up the shame of our desires, guilty feelings due to past relationships and other sexual blocks.\n\nMaking love on this level means reclaiming your sexual being fully in all its juiciness.\n\nThis sex is wet; you enjoy the taste of your lover\u2019s liquids, you exchange fluids, your bodies are moving, floating on each other\u2019s bodies as if you were in water. Think of actual sex in water. Sensual, sexy and arousing. Lots of kissing and sensual touch is involved. You can even explore role play, kick-start your creativity move it into the bedroom and explore each other\u2019s fantasies. Squirting G-spot fun is also a strong expression on this chakra.\n\nFood for thought: To get wet and juicy you want to heal what\u2019s holding you back. Are you loving your partner\u2019s taste? Do you enjoy kissing with deep wet tongue? How about oral sex? Do you love to use your tongue a lot? Communicate your shame and disgust. Work on what you desire and express this side in yourself.\n\nElement: Water\nFocal point: Two finger width above your pubic bone, a few centimeters outside of your body\nPosition: Missionary\nSense: \u00a0Taste (tongue)\n\nOMG, sex on this chakra is so hot (literally!). Focus on your navel chakra while you are having sex and you will trigger incredible deep passion. The play is going to be sweaty, hot temperature wise and intense. It\u2019s a latin dating night. It\u2019s a night where you pin your lover down, while you are riding them intensely from the top.\n\nYou may be dominating, or you may be in a submissive position. Doesn\u2019t matter, try yourself out in power play (with a consensus of course) and notice tremendous healing on this level.\n\nConscious BDSM can be a beautiful way to experience this chakra on a deeper level.\n\nWith presence, you can heal your connection with power and reclaim it inside of yourself. Test your boundaries and the ones from your beloved safely.\n\nThe eyes are crucial here. Watch your lovers, see them for who they are. Sexual experiences on this level can support us in redefining pleasure and pain.\n\nOnce this chakra is purified it guides you into pleasure and supports you to heal old traumas where you lost power. The fire in this chakra transforms. The challenge is to bare the heat and to become present with the moment. Don\u2019t get tricked into fast sex; fire is hot, so we tend to get quicker so that it doesn\u2019t touch us. Try to lean into it. Be passionate but also slow to find your presence.\n\nFood for thought: Did you ever had a sexual experience in your life where you lost power? What\u2019s your relationship with power? Are you dominant or more submissive? How does sitting on top make you feel?\n\nElement: Fire\nFocal point: Center of your navel, a few centimeters outside of your body\nPosition: Riding on top\nSense: Seeing (eyes)\n\nHow would angels have sex? This is how Tantric Sex feels like on this chakra. It\u2019s magical. It\u2019s the most heart-opening most vanilla almost without penetration kind of sex. Due to bad break-ups or negative relationship experiences we are afraid to expose our heart into the open to look at the wounds and sadness our heart holds.\n\nPurifying on this level needs a courageous soul, but feels ultimate, so healing to enter into deep love.\n\nThe kinaesthetic aspect plays a crucial part here. The lighter your touch gets, the more heart chakra arousing it is. Use especially your fingertips, stroke your lover\u2019s skin, hover almost above their physical body entering their energetic body.\n\nBreasts are the key to heart chakra sex\n\nThe breasts are the physical extension of the heart chakra. For all gender, the nipples are one of the erogenous zones and want to be played with. The more aroused your nipples, the easier it is to focus on the heart center. Imagine you are making love on clouds, puffy, feathery, light almost levitating. Use your hands, feathers, silk and oil to move into body floating sex.\n\nFood for thought: Opening your heart may bring up tears of sadness, joy, and love. How do you want to be held by your beloved when you express this part of yourself?\n\nElement: Air\nFocal point: Center of your chest, a few centimeters outside of your body\nPosition: Full body skin contact, Doggy style\nSense: Skin (feeling)\n\nMaking love on the throat chakra enters a more metaphysical kind of sex. There is almost no physical touch involved. When the sexual energy rises to this level, you may experience a new sight, a sight that sees the divine part in your beloved. A sense of union between gods.\n\nExpressing truth in sex\n\nAt this stage your feel very confident to express what needs to be expressed. The expressed is your truth as a fully mature sexual being. It\u2019s a very surrendering state of full trust and truth. You explore at this stage what surrendering truly means.\n\nFood for thought: Are you holding your truth back? Are you able to speak up for yourself. Do you love and enjoy yourself?\n\nElement: Ether\nFocal point: Center of the throat, a few centimeter outside of your body\nPosition: Scissors Sex Position\n\nWhen the sexual energy flows into the third eye, and you are present with it, you may experience visions or intuitive downloads. It goes beyond the ordinary, as if you plugged into a higher power, a higher wisdom. Your subconscious opens up, and your natural sight might be blur and forms around you dissolve.\n\nYou are fully there. Fully present with every moment. The state of \u2018Now\u2019 fully integrates into your being.\n\nKnowing without words.\n\nYou plug into an intuitive state, where you know what\u2019s needed, where you are fully capable of seeing beyond the physical. Maybe the vibrating energy feels very intense in your head and along your spine.\n\nFood for thought: How present are you during sex? Where is your mind at? From what may you be running away?\n\nFocal point: Center of your forehead, a few centimeter outside of your body\nPosition: Yab Yum\n\nThis is the ultimate goal of Tantra. Raising your sexual energy all the way up to your crown chakra and experiencing oneness with your existence. When you make love on this chakra, you claim your divinity.\n\nFood for thought: What does merging with your beloved mean to you? Did you ever have a moment of becoming one with your partner? How did it feel like? What did you experience?\n\nFocal point: Top of your head, a few centimeter above your crown\nPosition: You lie opposite of each other on your back legs overlapping each other holding hands. No movement just beingness.\n\nDon\u2019t get too brainy on the nitty gritty\u2019s. Simply play and experiment. Start from the bottom (root chakra) and work your way up to the crown in one single lovemaking session. Focus on each Chakra for 5 minutes together with your partner or while you have a self-pleasure ritual. You can of course also make love on one Chakra alone where you go deeper into its essence. You can play Chakra related music that stimulates on another level. Try to embody each energy center.\n\nTry out the mentioned positions, focus your mind on the chakra itself, like in meditation. And allow the diversity of each chakra to unfold in your erotic consciousness.<|endoftext|>"}

This way \u00bb\n\nI remember the first time I discovered I could orgasm from my g-spot, years after I had my first clitoral orgasm. Discovering a new way to experience climax made me feel empowered and excited. I loved realizing that my body had a lot more pleasure to give me than I thought.\n\nThis excitement doesn\u2019t only apply to people with clits and g-spots. Men and people with penises are used to one kind of orgasm and one main source of pleasure: the penis.\n\nThe truth is, the male body has a lot of ways to feel pleasure as well!\n\nOne of those ways is the male anal orgasm, sometimes referred to as the male g-spot.\n\nSome of you may be seasoned veterans of the male anal orgasm. And for some this may be an entirely new body act to explore. Veterans and newbies alike, let\u2019s go through the facts together and unlock your full anal pleasure potential: what is a male anal orgasm? What does it feel like? How can I achieve it?\n\nThe male anal orgasm is all thanks to the prostate gland.\n\nUnderstanding the prostate gland is important to understanding how male anal pleasure works.\n\nThe prostate gland is located inside the body, between the anus and testicles. When stimulated, the prostate fills up with a fluid. This fluid eventually becomes a part of semen. The \u201cfilling up\u201d sensation that happens in the prostate is what causes the orgasmic experience in the anus!\n\nSounds interesting? Check out our Prostate Massage Online Course!\n\nThe feeling of any orgasm is going to vary from person to person.\n\nIn comparison to penile orgasms, many males say that the anal orgasm is more intense and full-bodied. It can also increase seminal fluid and change the consistency to be more watery.\n\nHaving an anal orgasm can also shorten the time between erections (known as the refractory period) by almost 50%. This can be beneficial for prolonged sexual encounters, whether you want to keep going for your partner or yourself.\n\nMultiple orgasms have long been thought of as a result of female g-spot orgasms only. The male anal orgasm proves that while the experiences might vary between sexes, the possibility of multiple orgasms for males does exist because male orgasm is not as simple as everyone tries to tell you!\n\nThe male anal orgasm can increase your opportunity for multiple orgasms in two ways. One, men describe the feeling of an anal orgasm as having \u201cmultiple waves.\u201d These waves will feel different from person to person, but some may interpret the experience of multiple waves as having multiple climaxes in a row.\n\nSecondly, the shortening of the refractory period makes it possible to achieve a second (or third, or fourth, or more!) climax faster. Instead of waiting the typical 20 to 30 minutes for another erection, you may only need to wait 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nThere is a laundry list of positives about the male anal orgasm. It can be longer, larger, and more intense. It also increases your ability to have multiple orgasms in a shorter period. If you are looking for a more intense sensation or longer sexual encounters, exploring the male anal orgasm and some specific\u00a0tantric techniques is your best bet.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the penile orgasm, though. In the same way, I fell in love with a new way to orgasm through my g-spot, the clitoral orgasm is still my favorite. I find some orgasms to feel better than the others!\n\nSome of you might jump up and down at the possibility of having more intense, drawn out orgasms. Others of us might find that thought overwhelming or unnecessary.\n\nOur bodies are here for us to give us pleasure, but we don\u2019t all have to experience every single way to feel pleasure. If penile orgasms are your thing, embrace that. If anal orgasms are, embrace that, too.\n\nLove both, or one. All experiences welcome!\n\nA good warm-up to the male anal orgasm is to use your own fingers to stimulate the perineum. The perineum is the patch of skin between the testicles and the anus. Sometimes referred to as the \u201ctaint,\u201d the perineum is a good introduction to anal pleasure for a few reasons. At the very least, easier to reach than the anus.\n\nIt can also feel less vulnerable to rub the exterior of our bodies versus being penetrated. As someone who likes both being penetrated and rubbed on the outside, I can vouch for this! The perineum skin is located outside of the prostate. While the experience of rubbing it may not be as intense as internal stimulation, men find it to still be enjoyable and can experience orgasmic pleasure from it.\n\nYou can use the same fingers that you used to rub your perineum to insert inside your anus.\n\nBefore you do this, you can make sure your fingers can actually reach inside your anus. Some of us are blessed with long torsos and short arms, which can make this difficult. Don\u2019t worry, totally normal! If you fall into this category, skip ahead and read about toy and partner options.\n\nIf you can reach your anus in a comfortable position, it\u2019s time to talk lube.\n\nLube is incredibly important any time ANY penetration takes place.\n\nWhile our bodies are capable of creating our own lubricant, using a lube product too can take the pressure off your body to do all the work itself. It also makes penetration earlier on in a sexual experience more comfortable.\n\nWe\u2019ve got our hands and our lube, what else? Well, sex toys, of course! There are a few different toy options when it comes to anal play.\n\nDildos can take the place of fingers or a phallus, but with you leading the action.\n\nAnal plugs offer a way to gently prepare the anus for penetration and play.\n\nVibrators can offer penetration or external pleasure, and they do even more of the work for you with their motions!\n\nBeads offer a more specific experience \u2013 they are inserted and then slowly removed. Many people find the sensation of the insertion or removal to be quite pleasurable.\n\nDon\u2019t worry \u2013 good sex toy brands make sure their toys won\u2019t get lost inside!\n\nThe options for ways to stimulate or massage your prostate, anus and perineum are endless. Because the prostate is an internal organ, there\u2019s even the possibility of a hands-free way to orgasm, similar to how women can use kegels and pelvic floor exercises to orgasm.\n\nAll the ways you can pleasure yourself solo can be introduced with a partner(s). Communicating with your partner(s) is a great opportunity to get closer to one another, and it also allows room for more creativity.\n\nYour partner may have ideas that bring more heat to the table.\n\nShare your toys and what kind of pressure or stimulation feels good.\n\nOne thing that partnered play offers that solo does not is the option of penetration by your partner\u2019s penis @(anal sex) or by your partner wearing a strap-on (pegging). Either of these can offer a similarly pleasurable experience as fingers and toys can, but with an added intensity and intimacy factor.\n\nBeing penetrated can feel very vulnerable, whether you\u2019re a pro or totally new to it. Take caution with yourself in these encounters, and know that it\u2019s okay to feel vulnerable. In fact, a lot of people even find the vulnerability to feel pleasurable. Wherever your boundary is, it is okay and normal!\n\nThe male anal orgasm is its own type of orgasm that can be achieved by internal or external stimulation.\n\nIt can be reached on its own or with a penile orgasm as well.\n\nBoth ways to orgasm should feel amazing. There\u2019s no reason to pick favorites. Your body is yours to discover and you have every right to feel every ounce of pleasure from your body as you can. Go get anal-sploring!<|endoftext|>"}

With the potential to transform our relationship with ourselves, our lovers, and the world around us, our masturbation practice just needs a little push in the sex-positive direction.\n\nWe interviewed Love, Sex, and Relationship Coach, Andrea Balboni of Lush Coaching, to learn about her insight into working with and speaking to hundreds of different men on this path to finding healthy relationships\u2013\u2013in particular the one with ourselves. She suggests using holistic male masturbation techniques as a tool for self-love.\n\nFor clarity, we\u2019ll mostly be referring to male masturbation practices for cis men (men who are the same gender they were assigned with at birth). However, this article is also for anyone, looking to transform their masturbation practice into one that is more wholesome, invigorating, and empowering. NB. Not all men have penises and not all penis-owners are men.\n\nI believe to truly love yourself as a man in today\u2019s society, you must come to accept all parts of you, exactly as you are. Yes, that includes the parts that you are ashamed of, might have hidden away or shut down. The parts that feel fearful, weak, and small. The parts that you are told don\u2019t make you a \u201creal man.\u201d\n\nMen just want sex a lot more than women, right? Wrong. Men are stereotypically perceived to be highly sexualized beings that \u201cneed\u201d sex, to a degree that it\u2019s even uncontrollable. And those men who aren\u2019t sexual enough, well, they aren\u2019t \u201creal men\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re told that men\u2019s sexual release is a necessity, otherwise, they get blue balls.\n\nThink about it, a \u201cwanker\u201d, a common derogatory term in the UK, is someone who\u2019s not respected. For guys, masturbation must be done quickly and in the dark, hidden at home, shrouded in shame.\n\nSelf-pleasure is an excellent way to love yourself. When it\u2019s done mindfully and with presence, you are actually honoring your body and its desires.\n\nMale masturbation as a self-love practice guides you through exploring your full sexual potential, as well as your wildest desires, and all forms of pleasure. This is to help you understand all the different facets of who you are\u2013\u2013and to love yourself for it!\n\nTo celebrate and appreciate your full sexual self also has added benefits to your everyday life.\n\nThere are so many!\n\nWhile masturbation can offer a quick release from stress, changing our entire attitude can help it become something that is nourishing, leaving us with a good feeling for a longer period of time.\n\nIt can help you feel better about your body and overcome any shame or feeling as if your desires are out of your own control. It allows you to free yourself from judgment around your sexuality and get a better sense of yourself so that you can explore your body and pleasure in a whole new way.\n\nCertainly! This practice can help you become a better lover, as well as enhance your own experience in lovemaking.\n\nEnjoying a self-love masturbation practice engages you to have more control over your body, making you more sexually confident.\n\nAnd we all know that confidence is sexy!\n\nBeing present during pleasure allows you to be more in your body and in the moment, rather than stuck in your head. This will have immediate benefits when you have sex with a partner. Being present with yourself allows you to be more present with another.\n\nThis is because the more you know your own body, the more you can relax in bed with another person. You will be able to verbalize what feels good, and what you like because you know it!\n\nIn shifting your mindset around your masturbation practice helps to recognize your own inner power, and the outward expression of it, however it shows up.\n\nSo, when taking the time to explore masturbation in this new way, it\u2019s important to notice what feels good and inviting more of that in. This can be done by saying yes to pleasure, and to what feels good. Being kind to your body, and being patient with it, while allowing whatever happens to happen, or not, but just knowing that it\u2019s all ok.\n\nRight, so now we have the theory, but how do you go about starting a self-love male masturbation practice?\n\n\u2026to try out when you next want to explore masturbating as a self-love practice.\n\nBreathe in and out through your mouth. Faster breath can stimulate you more and boost your energy. Slow and steady breaths will allow you to relax back from your point of no return with greater control and ease.\n\nAllow yourself to surrender to your own voice. Release and tap into your raw sexual energy. Making noise frees you up for a more full experience. It releases you into your primal instinctual state. Let go so that you can receive pleasure more easily.\n\nSlow down, focus on the present moment, and be in your body. Allow more space for feeling and experiencing every sensation and emotion.\n\nAllow your body to move in masturbation as it would in lovemaking. This rewires your brain and body to release your patterns around masturbation and pleasure.\n\nTry exploring new movements, or touching your whole body to break up your routine. Exploring the sensitivity of different body parts will help to spread pleasure throughout your body and open you up to expanded states of pleasure, like a full-body orgasm.\n\nUse all four tools together to send the energy from the head of your penis to the other parts of your body.\n\nThank you for speaking with us Andrea. We totally agree that we need to diminish the stigma and change the common perception around male masturbation.\n\nWe can do this step by step, and you can be a part of it too. Though we\u2019ve just shared some guidance on where to start, we hope this is just the beginning of your journey toward self-exploration. Learn to love your body, work on healing your shame, and be part of this masturbation revolution by practicing it consciously.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Andrea and her work, head to her site www.lushcoaching.com.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Why the Male Orgasm Is Not as Simple as Everyone Tries to Tell You\n\n\n\nWherever you look, there is the common belief that the female orgasm is like a mystical, secret garden\u2026 an art form, while the male orgasm is like a simple algorithm.\n\n\u201cWomen require hours to orgasm (if they orgasm at all).\u201d\n\n\u201cMen need a tight grip and 5-7 minutes of in and out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen need emotional safety for letting go.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen need a tight grip and 5-7 minutes of in and out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen need to be treated like a goddess, with incense, foreplay and massage oil.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen need a tight grip and 5-7 minutes of in and out.\u201d\n\nYou know what I\u2019m getting at\u2026 there is an imbalance!\n\nI\u2019m asking: is there really?\n\nOr are we perhaps looking at male sexuality in the wrong way?\n\nI think we are. When the media writes and talks about male sexuality, they are talking about a very superficial part of it.\n\nHaving approached sexuality open-mindedly for most of my adult life, and having experimented with various set-ups, techniques, and traditions, I would say: there is much more to male sexuality than everyone talks about.\n\nSo what is everyone getting wrong? Multiple things.\n\nOne of the major problems I see in mainstream sex is that men are disconnected from the sensations in their penis.\n\nYep, exactly the same issue that many claim is the case for women and their vaginas.\n\nThe cause is a different one though: men have bad self-pleasure habits.\n\nWay too many men suffer from one or another state of the death grip: they have lost precious sensitivity in their penis from masturbating too frequently with a too tight grip. The problem is all over the internet.\n\nBut most act when it\u2019s already pretty late\u2026 read: when they can\u2019t come from vaginal or oral stimulation anymore, but only from handjobs (preferably given by themselves, because their partner\u2019s grip is too weak).\n\nThe second consequence of bad masturbation habits is too frequent ejaculation. As much as men hate to admit it, everyone knows it\u2019s true.\n\nRemember the times when you didn\u2019t ejaculate for a week and then had sex? An entirely different experience!\n\nEjaculating less frequently is not an option for most men because of mainstream sex, ejaculation equals orgasm. And that\u2019s a very limiting belief that we have to work on. (More on this later\u00a0coming later in the article.)\n\nAnd well, if you\u2019re already into earth-shattering and something-else kind of orgasms and want to try skipping ejaculation, you might want to check what prostate massage is known to deliver.\n\nVery connected to the lack of sensitivity down there, is the fact that male sexuality is often limited to happening down there.\n\nWomen need to warm up their entire body before they are ready for genital stimulation. Men\u2026 are born ready.\n\nBut what men need desperately and don\u2019t know, is duringplay, rather than\u00a0foreplay. Basically, they need full body stimulation and sensations during or after high states of genital arousal.\n\nA Tantra teacher first introduced me to this phenomenon, and I find it super interesting\u2026\n\nIf you want, it\u2019s a reflection of the anatomical structure of the genitals: For women, it\u2019s going from the outside to the inside. From full-body stimulation to local stimulation. For men, it\u2019s going from the inside to the outside. From local stimulation to full-body stimulation.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty magical!\n\nAnd almost no men do this to themselves while masturbating. Nor do they ask their partners to do it.\n\nTry it, it\u2019s an incredibly easy win!\n\nAfter generally not being very sensitive, another important reason for male sexuality being viewed as limited and simple is the impact of gender roles on our sexual behavior.\n\nMost men enjoy being the penetrator, and take on the more dominant role that comes with this. A role that is, at least emotionally, very simple.\n\nAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with that \u2014\u00a0I personally also enjoy it a lot, and practice it most of the time.\n\nBut that is far from being all there is to be lived\u00a0and enjoyed in the bedroom.\n\nAll the emotional rewards that come from the more vulnerable aspect of sexuality (which is very present in female orgasms as we know them)\u00a0are also available to men. But almost every man is blocked from accessing them.\n\nA man starting to cry while making love is unfortunately not something humanity seems to be ready for. But it\u2019s beautiful. And only one facet of a high bandwidth of emotions that men tend to avoid.\n\nMen have an equal potential to surrender into the act of making love, but gender roles play a limiting role to prevent them from doing so.\n\nNow comes what I think is the most important point of this article. And the previously made points compile beautifully into this one.\n\nEveryone underestimates the complexity of male sexuality.\n\nAnd the main reason for those limiting beliefs is that, in common knowledge, ejaculation equals orgasm.\n\nThis is\u2026 unbelievably sad. And unbelievably wrong.\n\nLike women, men are capable of having different types of orgasms. Shallow orgasms, deep orgasms, peak orgasms, multiple orgasms, full body orgasms. And not all of them include ejaculation.\n\nLimiting the male orgasm to the common ejaculation orgasm is like limiting the female orgasm to a clitoral orgasm.\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 limited.\n\nSo why is this limiting belief out there?\n\nHonestly, I have no idea. I\u2019m actually quite flabbergasted by it. It\u2019s not that no one is talking about it and teaching other ways.\n\nThere\u2019s Mantak Chia with his best-selling book\n[amazon link=\u201dB00N4FAT4A\u201d title=\u201dThe Multi-Orgasmic Man\u201d /]. There\u2019s Barbara Kessling\u2019s [amazon link=\u201d006092621X\u201d title=\u201dHow to Make Love All Night\u201d /].\n\nThere\u2019s Tantra and Taoism, which have been teaching it for centuries.\n\nThere\u2019s Lingam Massage as the famous technique that is known to get men there.\n\nThere are many contemporary sex coaches helping people get there.\n\nLet me tell you from my own experience that it\u2019s not a walk in the park learning it. Because we have to deal with all the struggles mentioned within this very article.\n\nI can\u2019t go into the concrete how\u2019s at this point. But check out the above-mentioned books or Tantra workshops in your town.\n\nAs you know by now, the whole topic is not that simple. Did you have any idea that there are 8 different types of male orgasms? You\u2019ve likely heard that there are several types of female orgasms, but what about the guys?!\n\nBeyond the 8 types of orgasms for men, you may not realize that male orgasms can be faked. When the topic of faked orgasms arises, most people think of women.\n\nDespite popular belief, one in four dudes says they\u2019ve faked an orgasm.\n\nAnother component to discovering the different types of male orgasms is to understand that no two orgasms will be the same. However, most men will experience a series of sensations during the process of getting off and coming. These sensations typically involve arousal, plateau, orgasm, resolution, and refraction.\n\nTo help you dive deeper into the topic, we\u2019ve outlined the 8 types of orgasms for men here.\n\nTo start off our list, we\u2019ve gotta cover the regular ejaculation orgasm first. This is the tried-and-true male orgasm we\u2019re all familiar with. Simply put, the regular ejaculation orgasm results in ejaculation of semen.\n\nAs one of the easiest kinds of male orgasms to achieve, a large portion of men will experience this type of climax every time they have sex or masturbate. The ejaculatory sensation can vary in intensity and is typically reached through penetration, repetitive thrusting, or stroking the penis.\n\nThe anal orgasm, sometimes referred to as the \u2018male G-spot orgasm,\u2019 is achieved by stimulating the prostate gland. Men can reach an anal orgasm alone or with the help of a partner. Through anal penetration, the prostate will fill up with fluid that will eventually be ejaculated.\n\nYou may be somewhat familiar with this type of orgasm, or it might be a whole new body part to explore during sex. If this is your first time with an anal orgasm, get ready for an out-of-this-world experience because it\u2019s often described as being more intense than a standard male orgasm.\n\nMen can experience the prostate orgasm by stimulating their prostate gland. The prostate is located just below your bladder and in front of your rectum. During stimulation, your prostate and seminal vessels will contract.\n\nProstate massage (or \u2018milking the prostate\u2019) is one of the best ways to have a prostate orgasm. Plus, the massage method can lead to deeper, more intense sexual experiences. Different types of prostate massage include internal prostate massage, direct prostate gland stimulation, and non-physical stimulation.\n\nSounds interesting?

Tantric techniques are a great way to learn to control your climax and extend your ejaculation. With enough practice and focus, you can learn to last for several minutes, an hour, or even hours\u2014everyone has a starting point!\n\nAn extended ejaculation orgasm will require focus, practice, patience, awareness, and the ability to be present during sex.\n\nBelieve it or not, men can have ejaculation-free orgasms. Sometimes referred to as a \u2018dry male orgasm,\u2019 an ejaculation-free climax can be achieved by practicing ejaculation control. Similar to the extended ejaculation orgasm, you can learn to prevent or delay coming during sex or masturbation by developing strong pelvic muscles or trying tantric techniques.\n\nTry practicing with masturbation first.\n\nWith the right timing and focus, you\u2019ll be able to have an ejaculation-free orgasm. Also, with practice, multiple ejaculation-free orgasms can be reached while you\u2019re getting it on.\n\nGuys can have a hands-free orgasm by utilizing a variety of methods. Get your rocks off sans hands through meditation, watching pornography, reading erotic content, flexing your PC muscles, or using stimulating fabrics.\n\nThe hands-free male orgasm is sometimes referred to as the \u2018energy orgasm.\u2019 It can be a fun one to try because climaxing without using your hands will open your mind to new techniques and allow you to let go of your usual masturbation habits. The idea is to get your penis to begin to twitch without touching anything. Soft or silky fabrics can be used if you\u2019re just starting out with a hands-free orgasm.\n\nFocus, visualize and keep practicing until you\u2019re able to reach the big O.\n\nListen up, guys! Nipple orgasms are not just for the ladies. To have a male nipple orgasm, start by gently touching your nipples or having your partner touch them. Rubbing, licking, sucking, flicking, or light pinching can usually lead to arousal. Try alternating between your nipples until they become hard and erect.\n\nVisualize a dirty scenario that you know will get you off.\n\nAs you get going, increase the pressure on your nipples (or have your partner do this) to crank up the intensity. Reaching climax with only nipple stimulation may take a few tries, but with practice, it can be achieved without much effort. In fact, stimulating your nipples is just one of the many sensations that can be intensified to reach an orgasm.\n\nThe full-body orgasm sometimes referred to as the \u2018blended male orgasm,\u2019 stimulates both pathways that connect to a man\u2019s pelvic region. It can be reached by stimulating the penis and prostate at the same time. Your nipples and other body parts can be aroused to experience a more intense full-body orgasm.\n\nMen can also have a full-body or blended climax through multiple orgasms during sex (ejaculation-free, nipple, penis, and prostate). A full-body orgasmic experience will happen when all senses are activated and everything happens at once.\n\nThere are likely plenty more than 8 types of male orgasms that have yet to be discovered or documented. According to Tantra, it\u2019s possible to turn all sensations in the body into orgasmic ones. With the male orgasm, the possibilities are endless.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s look back at what we now know:\n\nWith these points in mind, it\u2019s not surprising that male sexuality is generally seen as very primitive.\n\nBut imagine these four issues being resolved.\n\nThat would mean men actually could feel sensations in their penis. That they would be able to feel vaginal walls. The swollen G-Spot. The entrance of the cervix.\n\nIt would mean that men could spread orgasmic sensations throughout their entire body, instead of only experiencing them locally.\n\nThat would mean men could surrender and let go during making love. Instead of being limited to being a mechanical penetrator.\n\nIt would mean men could be able to have multiple orgasms. Men could choose to ejaculate, or not to ejaculate. There would be a huge variety of orgasms available to them.\n\nUnder those circumstances, would you still claim that the male orgasm is simple and mechanical?<|endoftext|>"}

Like any muscle training, these pelvic floor exercises for men and women, done consistently, can go a long way.\n\nYou might be wondering how long does it take to strengthen the pelvic floor? Well, after a couple of practices, you are likely to see some enhanced pelvic happiness, such as vagina tightening and penis strengthening. However, most people need a few months of consistent practice to receive full benefits.\n\nYour PC muscles support the organs that lie on it. Weak muscles can have pretty detrimental effects, including incontinence when you cough or sneeze, passing wind when you bend, heaviness in the vagina, and overall reduced sensation in the genitals.\n\nOn the flip side, overworking the PC muscles can have just as bad an impact by weakening the tissue and reducing any of the benefits you worked so hard on! So treat this as a sensitive muscle that needs gradual strengthening and plenty of rest and relaxation between poses and between sessions.\n\nOh yeah, you heard us right. Strong PC muscles will add even more pleasurable sensations to each and every sexual encounter you have, whether that\u2019s during masturbation or sex with a lover.\n\nThese exercises send blood flow to the genitals and awaken nerve endings that may have gone to sleep due to hormonal fluctuations, diet, or medication. It also signals to the pleasure receptors in your brain \u2013 giving you all the yummy feelings.\n\nThe more you do these exercises, the more you will be able to bring mindful attention to your genitals and be present during sex. Ultimately, enhancing your pleasure potential!\n\nDue to the enhanced blood flow in the area, the glands that produce lubrication are more activated to release more liquid. This is great for people who might suffer from vaginal dryness (for those of you out there, just remember, lube is your best friend too).\n\nBy doing vagina tightening and penis strengthening exercises, you will find your orgasms also become stronger. This is because when you climax, the body is experiencing a contraction and relaxation of these particular muscles. Thus, the stronger they are, the deeper and more intense the orgasm can feel.\n\nWith enough time and practice, along with a conscious breathing routine, you may come to find you can experience multiple orgasms. That\u2019s right, multiple orgasms aren\u2019t limited to the vulva-owners out there. These pelvic floor exercises for men will also help you to ride the multiple waves of penis pleasure.\n\nFor anyone with a penis struggling with premature ejaculation, or wanting to avoid erectile dysfunction, pelvic floor exercises for men can offer more control over your body, stronger erections, and improved prostate health.\n\nThese muscles are also in charge of your continence. As you get older these muscles naturally get weaker and urine and bowel incontinence can be avoided with these simple exercises.\n\nWhen locating your PC muscles, you can place a finger inside the vagina, or over the perineum (just in between the genital and anus), and squeeze as if you were holding in your pee. Alternatively, you can test this muscle when actually peeing, holding, and releasing\u2013\u2013that\u2019s your focal point!\n\nBe aware to not hold in your urine too often, or do your exercises while on the loo, as this can cause Urinary Tract Infections.\n\nSo now you\u2019ve located them, it is vital that you know relaxing is just as important contracting!\n\nIn between contractions, as you breathe in notice your belly expanding and gently pushing down on your pelvic floor (as if you were peeing) to release the tension.\n\nWithout releasing the muscles, your body doesn\u2019t strengthen, and the area can become too tight, causing complications such as hypertonic pelvic floor later on.\n\nSo, how long does it take to strengthen the pelvic floor per session? You must contract for at least three seconds and release for at least three seconds. Consistency is key, but this needs to be gradually built up. Start with two or three times a week and build up to five times a week.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to do all of the following pelvic floor exercises for men and women, pick a few of your favorites and set a timer for three minutes, building up to 10-minute practices after a few weeks.\n\nThe following exercises have been taken from our YouTube video with Sensuality Coach, Rosie Reese who teaches you how to tone the intricate muscles of your glutes, pelvis, and the lower abdominal muscles.\n\nFor vagina tightening, these exercises can be done with or without a yoni egg or kegel balls!\n\nAll you will need is a comfortable place on your floor, ideally on a rug or exercise mat, and a cushion handy for comfort.\n\nJust as in Vinyasa yoga, connect the movements to your breath. This will focus your attention on your genitals, make the movements flow easier, and send plenty of oxygen and heat to the pelvic floor.\n\nTo start, sit crossed legged. Make it comfortable for your pelvis. If you choose to sit on a cushion if you want to avoid straining your knees. This is a great grounding move for getting the focus out of your head and shifting the energy into the base of your body.\n\nSitting upright, hands on your knees, spiral your belly button in one direction as if you are stirring a pot. Notice your base connecting with the ground. Do 10 of these spirals, and reverse the direction.\n\nCome to lie on your back, feet on the mat, knees pointing at the ceiling. With your arms by your side, push into your heels lifting your pelvis upwards, and then bring your body back to the ground. Breathe in to lift, and breathe out to release 10 times.\n\nBonus exercise: Add an extra 10 mini pulsing thrusts.\n\nThis is an advanced version of Bridge Thrust. While you\u2019re in the same position, lift one leg up, bending at the knee and keeping it parallel to the ceiling. Repeat the same motion of lifting your hips. Do this 10 times and change legs.\n\nStaying on your back, lift your knees with your shins parallel to the ceiling. Open your legs to the sides as far as they can go. Rest there, breathe in, and exhale as you squeeze them together. Repeat this 10 times.\n\nThis move is similar to Open the Doors, just with your legs straight up. Now straighten your legs and lift them from the side to the ceiling. Keep your feet flexed, and activate your PC muscles to help you out! Repeat 10 times.\n\nTurn to lie on your side, knees bent. Open up your top leg as if your knees are a clamshell opening wide. Your pelvic floor muscles are the pearl, so show them off. Try this 10 times.\n\nBonus exercise: Shift your shins further forward and open your legs and feet, making a bigger clamshell opening.\n\nThis classic cat and cow position is useful for building heat and energy in your pelvic floor. On all fours, round your spine, head down, tailbone down, back lifted, into an angry cat shape. On an inhale pull your chest forward, lift your bum and your head slowly, into a happy cow shape. Contracting your pelvic floor on the exhale, releasing on the inhale.\n\nWhile on all fours in a neutral position, lift your belly button, tuck in your ribs and lift one arm and the opposite leg (so your left arm and your right leg), hold for 10 and release. Switch sides and repeat 10 times.\n\nThis is like a cat-cow but on your knees. Sit upright and open your chest out, chin up. Then round your body, curving your spine, chin down. Move the spine back and forth, imagine energy radiating up and down your spine from your pelvic floor to your head.\n\nGet on all fours. Spread the fingers wide to set up your foundation. Keeping your knee bent, extend one leg up, foot to the sky, and draw the knee into the chest. Repeat on the other side. Do 10 of these.\n\nSit on your heels, if comfortable. Inhale and lift yourself up, away from your feet. Exhale lower it down. Repeat 10 times.\n\nWhile on all fours, wag your tail like an excited puppy. Wiggle your hips left and right, making sure to relax your pelvic floor muscles.\n\nLie on your back, feet to the floor. Simply allow your knees to fall to the left and then to the right, while simultaneously \u201cpushing down\u201d (as if peeing) to relax and release your pelvic floor.\n\nWhile you\u2019re still on your back, hug the knees in and roll them around in circles. This will help to spread the energy through the body, while relaxing and massaging the sacrum.\n\nWhen it comes to your pelvic floor health, be sure to practice little and often to reap the full benefits. Perhaps you could send this to a lover and practice together. You can even make it a challenge and compare notes when you next have sex.\n\nDon\u2019t forget, it\u2019s not all about sexual pleasure, these exercises offer lifelong health rewards too! If you are looking to try these out with a yoni egg, check out our Yoni Egg Course where we have in-depth information and follow-along video tutorials too.\n\nNB: Not all penis-owners are men, and not all vulva-owners are women. Anyone with a penis or vagina can enjoy these pelvic floor exercises.<|endoftext|>"}

Sex makes us healthier by improving sleep quality, boosting immunity, relieving stress and anxiety, improving our mood and heart health, reducing risk of breast and prostate cancer, and increasing our self-esteem and sense of meaning in life.\n\nDuring our period, sex can relieve menstrual cramps, alleviate other forms of bodily pain like lower back pain and headaches, and can increase a woman\u2019s chances of becoming pregnant when her next ovulation rolls around.\n\nWhat is not to love about period sex?\n\nThat simple question is something of a mystery since very few women talk about their periods, much less the sex they have during that time. In general, if a woman is not in pain during her period, she enjoys period sex. What women don\u2019t enjoy is the mess it makes, which is why having sex that week without the mess is an art worth mastering!\n\nWomen bleed around one week a month for forty years (that\u2019s 3,360 days over the course of their lifetime) unless their cycle has been altered by hormonal birth control, fibroids, pregnancy or other factors. That\u2019s a significant amount of time to not be having sex!\n\nAs a sex therapist and coach, I am committed to helping women get all the great perks of sex as much as possible.\n\nCan you have sex on your period without hours of soaking, scratching, washing, and bleaching out period blood? Or without the shame of getting it on other people\u2019s sheets and towels and the endless bed-remaking?\n\nTrust me, I\u2019ve done it all. And fortunately, the answer is: yes, you can!\n\nA commitment to let go of any ideas that period sex is dirty, shameful, smelly, embarrassing or that men don\u2019t like it. A decision to let go of the patriarchal idea that cleaning up and laundry is the job of the woman\n\nAcceptance of the idea that, to quote Dossie Easton, \u201csex is nice and pleasure is good for you\u201d and never is that more true than during your period!\n\nAs a sex coach, I find that a lot of women have trouble communicating they want sex. They prefer their partner read their mind and initiate.\n\nIn the case of period sex, women want their partners to give them the green light that sex in the presence of blood is okay.\n\nBut if you want to master period sex you have to recognize that there nothing wrong or weird about having sex during your period and initiate it with your partnefr.\n\nWhether you want to have sex because you\u2019re horny, or you want all the pleasurable, relaxing, meditative and soothing benefits of sex- go for it! Just communicate that you want sex with your partner (or yourself) and get started.\n\nI\u2019ve personally stopped saying, \u201cI\u2019m on my period\u201d and have started saying, \u201cLet me grab my mat!\u201d It\u2019s so much more empowering!\n\nIf you are using an internal product like a tampon or menstrual cup you can remove that on the toilet. Use a finger to enter and make a circular swipe of your vagina to remove any excess blood that is sitting there.\n\nIf you are wearing a diaphragm or cervical cup that you want to leave in during sex, you can remove it and dump the excess blood in the toilet and put it back in. Wipe the vulva afterwards with a wet and soapy hand or a biodegradable wipe.\n\nSome women like to use a diaphragm, cervical cup, a LUWI (a second skin that lines the vaginal or anal canal) or a female condom during period sex. These products can prevent blood from coming out during sex, but they don\u2019t always guarantee it.\n\nSo follow the steps outlined in this guide until you\u2019ve developed a mastery of period sex that works for you!\n\nLay down with your wipeable surface underneath your butt if you\u2019re on your back, or slide it under your partner\u2019s butt if you start on top. If it\u2019s a small pad, it should go right underneath your partner\u2019s balls or vulva to catch any dripping blood.\n\nPut on a condom at this time if you are not with a tested partner or are using them to prevent pregnancy. If you are having sex at the end of your period and you ovulate early, you can still become pregnant from period sex.\n\nStart slowly to gauge how your vaginal tissue is and what the lubrication is like. Sometimes period blood can make things extra slippery and sometimes your vagina can feel a little extra swollen or sensitive. It\u2019s okay if sex feels more conservative during this time.\n\nFrom there, discover what types of movement and angles feel good to you, knowing that your wipeable surface is there to catch any blood that leaks out. You can relax and enjoy the moment.\n\nIf a lot of blood falls on the pad you can wipe it with a tissue mid-sex, or while changing positions. If your partner get blood on their hand, they can wipe it on the mat or pad, or grab a tissue next to the bed.\n\nFor some women their vagina feels more sensitive so they prefer slow sex, while other women want hard penetration and can feel even deeper waves of pleasure during their cycle. Sex during your period can feel especially primal, and some women report period sex being their favorite time to have sex!\n\nSex changes daily based on our moods, energy level, connection with our partner and hormone levels. So stay open that it can keep changing for you as you change your perceptions, age, have babies, and change partners.\n\nWhen we bleed on a towel or the bed, we spend those moments after sex wondering how much of a mess we\u2019ve made or thinking about the clean up awaiting us. If we\u2019re away from home, like at a hotel, we are already dreading what the maid is going to find. We don\u2019t linger very long in enjoyment because we want to prevent making more of a mess!\n\nWhen we\u2019ve mastered the art of period sex, we get to relax and enjoy.\n\nYou and your partner can cuddle and enjoy talking about the orgasm(s) you had. You can even fall asleep!\n\nWhen you decide to get up, put your hand under your vulva to catch any blood that might drip down as you make your way to the toilet or shower for a rinse with water or a biodegradable wipe.\n\nWhen you return to the bed simply toss the bloody tissues out, or rinse your reusable pad or Adult Play Mat\u00ae. If sex toys were used, make sure to clean your toys after every sexual experience.\n\nDidn\u2019t I tell you that period sex mastery was totally possible?\n\nThere are some people who enjoy getting blood everywhere (hello, blood fetish) and some women are fine just waiting for the maid or hotel service to clean up (btw, if the hotel can\u2019t get the stains out, they throw the sheets out) but most of us care about the clean up and want a better option for sex during our periods.\n\nThese step-by-step instructions can be used in your home, on vacation, and even at your friend or in-laws house!\n\nSex should be enjoyed all month long because the health benefits are just too good to pass up.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget that mastering the art of period sex does not require a partner \u2013 masturbation or self-pleasuring during your period has all the same health benefits and follows these exact same steps.\u00a0So go grab your vibrator!\n\nSex is beautiful and oh-so-good for you.\n\nMaster the art of period sex and you get to enjoy great sex all month long<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Premature Ejaculation \u2013 The Ultimate Mindful Guide [2020]\n\n\n\nIt is a far too common (and partly unjustified) concern for men whether or not they last long enough in bed to satisfy their partners.\n\nThe truth is no matter how much sexual confidence a man tries to boast in front of his friends, we all have wondered at one point or another if we could do something to last a little longer in bed.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to master the art of ejaculation control and make sure you come out as an expert lover every time you have sex with someone, we\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nThis article will teach you how to control your orgasms, but more importantly, it will help you end all the questions and concerns you may have around the topic of premature ejaculation.\n\nThe first thought most of us have when we are trying to last longer in bed is that we need to \u2018cool off\u2019, or somehow learn to feel less pleasure, so we don\u2019t get to orgasm too quickly.\n\nBut it turns out we are doing it all wrong:\n\nejaculation control it\u2019s not about learning how to hold back on pleasure, but actually the exact opposite: learning how to experience pleasure more fully.\n\nBy understanding how both you and your partner can experience the flow of sexual energy through all of your body, you\u2019ll become acquainted with a type of pleasure that is far deeper and more intense than anything you\u2019ve experienced: so deep and intense that it will take away forever the whole pressure that surrounds time, ejaculation, and the need to \u2018perform\u2019.\n\nThe most important thing, though, is that you don\u2019t put pressure on yourself. If you use some of the self-awareness techniques we are sharing with you, you can work your way up to full-blown, multi-orgasmic sessions that can last for hours\u2026 But\u2026 you have to make it about you.\n\nIf you put your focus on lasting more in order to pleasure your partner, there will always be too much stress on your shoulders for you to relax out of your mind and connect with your body.\n\nAnd as you\u2019ll learn in this article, there are tons of ways you can please your woman in bed without having to use your penis at all.\n\nSo, take it slow, and dive into ejaculation control for your own benefit at first: the more pleasure you learn how to take in, the more confident and present you\u2019ll become for your partner\u2026 And that\u2019s way more attractive for a woman than you being all tight up just to last 5 more minutes.\n\nThere have been decades of research and studies debating the topic of premature ejaculation.\n\nSome people have defined it regarding numbers: you compare your time against the average for the population group you belong to: if you last less than two minutes after intercourse begins, then you\u2019re a PE subject according to many of the specialists who believe in this definition.\n\nOf course, depending on the control group as a reference for each study, the time barrier could be set at two, three, five, one and a half minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit pointless to talk about mean, median or average to try and describe something so subjective (and non-mathematical) as the experience of sex.\n\nSo other sex experts have ventured to define premature ejaculation as a male orgasm that takes place before his partner has reached a climax for herself.\n\nBut then again, this assumes that all women should always be ready to experience an orgasm through penetration and that every time this doesn\u2019t happen, both partners have somehow failed at having \u2018proper\u2019 sex.\n\nReally, how can you possibly measure when is the right time for a man to ejaculate? Mantak Chia claims that you actually can\u2019t.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t even believe the term \u2018premature ejaculation\u2019 should exist. Because the only time that is right for you to ejaculate is whenever you choose to do so!\n\nIt\u2019s not really a matter of time, but of being able to know your sexual response, so it\u2019s your choice when you let yourself get carried all the way to the point of explosion.\n\nIf the point of explosion takes you by surprise, then you can talk about uncontrolled ejaculation: the issue is not that you reach orgasm too quickly; is that you\u2019re reaching it too unconsciously.\n\nOne definition we like is by our expert for orgasm mastery, Eyal Matsliah:\n\n\u201cPremature ejaculation \u2013 Ejaculating before both partners are ready for it\u201d\n\nThere can be various causes for premature ejaculation but one primary reason for not being able to control your ejaculation is not being aware of all the sensations that surround your experience of sex.\n\nPleasure and orgasm work much in the same way as static electricity does. When you receive any kind of pleasant stimulation in your penis and its surrounding area, then a form of \u201csexual static\u201d starts to accumulate from all the bioelectrical impulses that are sent back and forth between your brain and your nerve endings.\n\nWhen the accumulated static becomes too much for your nerve endings to handle, there\u2019s a sudden release of energy: the orgasmic explosion that we all love so much.\n\nEjaculation happens when this explosion of sexual energy triggers a series of contractions in two different sets of pelvic muscles, which cause semen to be emitted and then ejected through the penis.\n\nIf we are not really aware of how our pelvic area is filling up with all the bioelectrical impulses of pleasure that we get from sexual stimulation, then it\u2019s easy to reach over the edge and ejaculate sooner than we\u2019d like to.\n\nThe first reason we tend to explode into orgasm without being able to control it is quite simple: going too fast and too furious.\n\nPorn and masturbation habits play a key role here: For one part, it is likely that our first self-pleasuring experiences happened in a rush because we were afraid to be discovered by some member of our family. But for another part, porn has always shown us that intercourse should happen at ultra-speed right away from the first second.\n\nBoth men and women have been conditioned to want \u2013\u00a0with a part of their minds \u2013 that frantic rhythm of thrusting because it looks \u2018hot\u2019 on the screen.\n\nNow, while there is a time and a place for everything, jumping into desperado-style intercourse straight away is usually a bad idea, because it sends a hurry-let\u2019s-cum-before-i-get-caught kind of message for the man.\n\nThe second, even more, common reason for uncontrolled ejaculation, is when we fill up our pelvic area with sexual energy\u00a0even without experiencing direct touch.\n\nBasically what happens is your brain is so programmed for wanting to get an orgasm ASAP (as soon as possible), that it doesn\u2019t wait to receive stimulation from your nerve endings: it basically simulates the stimulation in advance, and gets you so charged up that, of course, you won\u2019t be able to take a lot of actual stimulation in your penis without bursting into an orgasm.\n\nThis trigger for uncontrolled ejaculation operates at different levels for different men.\n\nFor people who are used to being very mental, and do not know any techniques to circulate sexual energy through their bodies, the bioelectric impulses in the penis can get too high just from the memories of pleasure that the brain projects (before any physical contact).\n\nMen who experience this kind on brain-centered experience can ejaculate the very instant they penetrate their partner.\n\nFor other men, the problem comes a bit later: they can start intercourse with a moderate degree of sexual tension, but at some point or another, their mind out speeds their body, the arousal in the brain getting so intense that the orgasmic release arrives at the pelvis too unexpected and sudden.\n\nAh, the irony. The third most common cause for ejaculating too fast is, well, the fear of ejaculating too fast.\n\nAnd right along this fear of not lasting long enough before ejaculating, is the fear of not being able to maintain an erection long enough, or not being able to get one in the first place.\n\nThe term performance anxiety, when it comes to sex, means putting yourself under so much stress about doing it right, that you\u2019re not even present in the doing it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not really following the sensations of your body, then it\u2019s easy to miss a sudden increase in sexual tension that gets you over the edge into an orgasm.\n\nYour brain can also trigger an uncontrolled ejaculation in two inadvertent ways.\n\nOne is by recreating the ejaculatory sensation in your pelvis against your will: it comes to your memory because you fear it may arrive soon. By thinking about it, you send to your penis precisely the kind of bioelectric impulses and tension that can activate an ejaculatory release.\n\nThe other way is if you sense you\u2019re having trouble maintaining your erection: your brain may deliberately create some \u2018additional\u2019 stimulation so more energy arrives at your pelvic area and your penis stays hard.\n\nThe only problem: if your mind sends the order that more energy needs to arrive, then it\u2019s easy to overcharge your penis with stimulation, and go from partially soft to involuntary ejaculation in under a minute.\n\nStopping uncontrolled ejaculation is not hard to do, but it can take a good deal of time and patience if you want to do it in a way that sticks with you for the long term.\n\nThere are different pills and substances you can use as a quick-fix solution to modify your sexual response cycle, but we don\u2019t believe that depending on \u2018external\u2019 resources to define your personal experience of sex is a good idea.\n\nQuite the opposite, it\u2019s by knowing your inner resources and potential as a lover that you\u2019ll be able to not only overcome any concerns regarding ejaculation but actually expand your sexual horizons by sharing and receiving pleasure at the deepest possible levels.\n\nHere are five simple steps that you can follow if you want to master the art of lasting longer in bed naturally:\n\nDid you know that women have a capacity for pleasure of up to 16x compared to men?\n\nCaffyn Jesse, one of the leading experts in female sexuality in North America, made that estimation based on the number of nerve endings and the amount of erectile tissue that is present in the pelvic complex around the clitoris, the vagina, and the uterus.\n\nWith so much territory and sensorial capacity to be covered in a woman\u2019s body, it is just ridiculous that we continue to consider the penis as our primary resource to offer her pleasure.\n\nAs a matter of fact, even if we were absolute masters in the art of penis thrusting, and could go on for hours and hours each time we tried intercourse, we would be covering just a tiny fraction of all the stimulation techniques that can elevate a woman to the highest spheres of pleasure.\n\nNot in vain Mantak Chia claims that it will be your fingers, your mouth, and ultimately your whole body, the first and foremost resources you\u2019ll need to use to elevate your partner into blissful and ecstatic states.\n\nThe penis can always be brought into play a little later down the game. It sure is an amazing sensation for a woman to feel her partner inside her, but the truth is, if you do things the right way, she won\u2019t mind at all about the time you spend there\u2026\n\nIf you learn how to create a safe space for your partner to fully express her sexual being, and stimulate her extensively long before you even think about penetration, you\u2019ll feel relaxed because you\u2019ll know that you\u2019ve already offered her pleasure in so many different ways beforehand.\n\nAnd of course, you\u2019ll also understand that you can continue to carry her to new orgasmic heights after you\u2019ve had your orgasm because you don\u2019t need your penis at all when she has communicated to you many other ways in which she can surrender to pleasure.\n\nSo be a constant learner, and always stay open to explore all the ways in which you can please your partner. You\u2019ll take loads of pressure off your shoulders regarding your ejaculation control if you do so.\n\nP.S: If you want to learn more about the subtle forms of stimulation that women can experience, our Yoni Massage Course is a great place to start\n\nWe tend to forget our hormonal and energetical balance changes through the day. Some men experience a peak in sexual drive right after they get up from bed, while others may feel much more ready to engage in sexual activity somewhere in the middle of the day (or even, why not, in the middle of the night).\n\nBy adding some variety to your lovemaking schedule, and also having solo sessions to experience your receptiveness to pleasure at different times of the day, you\u2019ll appreciate when your body is more connected to sensorial bliss and sexual sensibility.\n\nHaving sex at a time when you\u2019re on a sexual peak (when you can get a harder erection, and have a larger threshold for stimulation without feeling the need to orgasm) will give you the confidence to master your ejaculation control.\n\nOf course, once you find your preferred time slot for expressing your full sexual power, you\u2019ll also have to take into account the time zone that works best for your partner.\n\nBut once you\u2019ve had the experience of connecting effortlessly to your most powerful version of sexual energy, and enjoying some pretty awesome sessions of sex with your partner at that time of the day, you\u2019ll be able to carry that same confidence to other situations and slots.\n\nDisconnection from your body often leads to unconscious orgasming: we\u2019ve already discussed how our brain can lead a quick overcharging of sexual energy when we\u2019re approaching sex too mentally.\n\nA simple and surprisingly effective way to prevent this is to do some bonding activity with your partner before sex, that helps both of you to feel grounded, connected, and present in your bodies.\n\nIn Tantra, we call this kind of bonding activities rituals because they are a shared moment of being mainly available for your partner, but even more importantly, for yourselves: it\u2019s a way of telling your body, your mind and your spirit that something very special is about to happen.\n\nBy doing this you program yourself beforehand to welcome pleasure, and really be open to enjoy all the sensorial experiences that you\u2019re treating yourself to in the next hours that you\u2019ll be sharing with your partner.\n\nIt can be a practice as simple as a full body massage, maybe doing some yoga stretches if you\u2019re both into it, or even just a calm bath.\n\nBy sharing this moment of physical connection, relaxing beyond any expectations or hurries, you\u2019ll get more in sync with your body and its sensations.\n\nThis will make sex a lot more enjoyable, but it will also bring awareness to your sexual response: you\u2019ll be able to detect subtle changes in how the accumulation of sexual energy in your pelvis progresses, so ejaculation can\u2019t catch you off-guard.\n\nIn general terms, women breathe more deeply and slowly during sex. By aligning your sexual rhythm with your spouse\u2019s, you\u2019ll be able to be more present in your sensations, so the urge to ejaculate doesn\u2019t dictate your whole experience of sex.\n\nAlmost all ancient cultures point in the same way when it comes to the nature of sexual mastery: lovemaking is an art that is driven by the feminine presence.\n\nIn other words, women tend to kick ass when it comes to sensorial capacity, so instead of trying to make her adapt to your rhythm, you\u2019ll obtain a lot more rewards if you\u2019re the one who makes a conscious effort to synchronize with her.\n\nAs a matter of fact, since women don\u2019t experience the need to ejaculate semen, their experience of sexual build up tends to be deeper, and involve their whole body.\n\nBy mimicking some of the caresses and movements she uses, you\u2019ll learn to expand your own sexual energy throughout all of your body as well.\n\nTaking the focus of pleasure away from the pelvis, and the rhythm of lovemaking away from the frenetic search for a quick release, you\u2019ll be able to join her in the sensations of bliss and connection that allow sex drive to manifest slowly and consistently, instead of burning out in just a few minutes.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, performance anxiety is one of the three decisive factors that can cause Premature Ejaculation.\n\nWhen you take the time to build openness and communication with a partner, the unconditional support you offer each other will make a huge difference in eliminating stress from the equation.\n\nWhen communication and deep trust are present in the relationship, you\u2019ll have the certainty that each of you is looking to be present for the other in ways that matter to them.\n\nThis will give you a deep certainty of the value you hold for the other person, in a psychological, emotional and of course also sexual dimension. And with such a sense of meaningfulness at the core of your relationship, there won\u2019t be room for the conventional male approach to sex as a competition, which is what makes us get lost in performance anxiety in the first place.\n\nPlus, this works to your benefit in another way. Not only you\u2019ll feel seen and appreciated by your partner (instead of judged by your performance), but she\u2019ll also feel completely safe to express the rawest and unfiltered parts of her sexuality, which is an absolute must for her to connect with all her potential for pleasure.\n\nSex is, after all, the most powerful kind of energy that lives within us, so it takes a lot of confidence, trust and self-knowledge to really explore the incredible heights into which it can lead us.\n\nBut the first step (which you\u2019ve already taken!) is to make a conscious effort to connect more deeply with our body: being always very patient, and completely accepting of all the learnings, the progress, and setbacks that both ourselves and our partner will experience through the process.<|endoftext|>"}

In fact, each year, more than 3 million medical cases of erectile dysfunction are recorded in the U.S.\n\nBased on the numbers, we should be talking about erectile dysfunction and how to fix it a lot more than we do. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of, and believe it or not, remedying the situation can be sexy and fun!\n\nErectile dysfunction is the inability to get an erection or keep one hard long enough to have sex. It is usually self-diagnosed with numerous symptoms. Those include the more obvious difficult time getting hard, maintaining an erection, lasting long enough in bed, and being able to orgasm as well as less obvious signs like a reduced desire to get it on.\n\nED can be caused by a number of different factors including age, stress, depression, injury, high blood pressure or cholesterol, obesity, and drug or alcohol use.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for men to experience erectile dysfunction at some point in their life, and there\u2019s totally hope for those going through it. What I\u2019m trying to say is:\n\nYou\u2019re not alone here, and there\u2019s plenty you can do to correct the problem.\n\nThe list of treatments for ED includes medication, implants, surgery, penis pumps, and various lifestyle changes such as exercise, drug or alcohol therapy, nutritional adjustments, stress management, or relationship work.\n\nBefore modern remedies were available, prostate massage was used to treat symptoms of erectile dysfunction, and for good reason! For those suffering from ED, prostate massage therapy may be just the thing to boost your confidence, improve your sex life, and save your relationship.\n\nIf you feel like you\u2019ve tried everything to fix the issue without any luck, you may be wondering if you should try prostate massage therapy for erectile dysfunction. The answer to this is: probably yes.\n\nThe prostate is a muscular gland found in men. It is located under the bladder and urethra, in front of the rectum, and it\u2019s the most vulnerable and sensitive gland in the male body.\n\nThe prostate is responsible for creating prostatic fluid which carries sperm and contains several muscles that help expel semen during ejaculation. When your prostate is taken care of and regularly stimulated, it can help you achieve out-of-this-world O moments.\n\nSo what is prostate massage and how does it relate to erectile dysfunction?\n\nProstate massage therapy (or \u201cprostate milking\u201d) is not currently a mainstream form of treatment for ED and is often used in conjunction with other types of treatment. The goal is to cause the prostate to contract, which will often lead to the release of prostatic fluid and semen.\n\nDuring prostate massage therapy, a lubricated finger\u2014always with gloves on\u2014or a specialized tool is used to carefully stimulate the prostate. Tissues in and around the prostate are massaged with gentle pressure.\n\nFor erectile dysfunction treatment, prostate massage therapy may take place two or three times a week over a period of one to two months. Depending on your current health condition and level of ED, the initial release of prostatic fluids during massage may cause some pain or discomfort.\n\nFor most men, prostate massage therapy will also produce pleasurable relief.\n\nBecause the prostate gland is extremely sensitive, massaging it can lead to an elevated orgasm without ejaculation. Got a partner? Even better. Having someone massage your prostate can be surprisingly hot.\n\nWhen blood flow is inhibited in your body, your pelvic area may become restricted. This causes erectile dysfunction. While the condition is not uncommon, it\u2019s a total bummer!\n\nProstate massage therapy works by increasing blood flow throughout the body and returning normal function to the penis. During massage treatment, the prostatic ducts are cleared of backed up fluid. Pretty awesome, right?\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Prostate massage therapy improves the symptoms of erectile dysfunction by helping to repair nerve damage in the groin and prostate areas and preventing infections. All of this leads to a healthy prostate gland which is required for a strong erection. Not only will prostatic massage improve your orgasms and sexual performance so you can get it on all night, but a hearty prostate is also vital for general health and wellbeing in all men.\n\nMassage may be performed on yourself, by a partner, or by a professional.\n\nIf you go the professional route, a primary care provider, urologist, or sexual health expert can refer you to a prostatic massage therapist.\n\nBefore settling on a provider, just make sure they specialize in prostate massage therapy and are not a general massage therapist. Your health insurance may or may not cover prostatic massage, but it\u2019s always worth looking into.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of consulting your partner for prostate massage therapy, the most important thing to remember is that the prostate tissues are especially sensitive. Communicate to your partner that they should use very gentle pressure during every stage of the massage.\n\nSecond, make sure the prostate area is clean before getting started and ensure that the finger or any tools used are disinfected.\n\nYou can also use a condom instead of gloves on the finger that will be doing the massage, and lubricant is highly recommended. Finger condoms are also a great option for prostate massage therapy.\n\nGet into position.\n\nThe best position to be in for prostate massage therapy is on all fours.\n\nIf you\u2019re not used to being in this position with your partner, remember that this exercise is all about trust, vulnerability, and relief.\n\nHave your partner begin by applying soft pressure to the muscles and tissues between your testicles and rectum as well as just above your pubic bone. When massaged, both areas will indirectly stimulate the prostate gland and provide sweet, sweet release.\n\nNext, a finger can be slowly inserted into your anus, about four inches deep. Prostate massage can be done in circular motions, back and forth, or with steady, targeted pressure on certain areas. With light pressure, your partner should move their finger back an inch or two which may cause some fluid to come out through your penis.\n\nRepeat these steps five to ten times per session.\n\nDuring prostate massage therapy, be sure to communicate with your partner on how much pressure feels okay, and what is too much.\n\nHaving someone you love perform prostate massage therapy on you can be an utterly sensual and erotic experience. It improves the spiritual and sexual connection between partners and could be exactly the thing to get you back on track after having erectile dysfunction.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re not ready to ask your partner or consult a professional for prostate massage therapy, it\u2019s worth trying out on your own. With solo prostatic massage, you\u2019ll be able to control the pressure which may be difficult to explain to someone else. Many men try DIY prostate massage before recruiting someone else.\n\nProstate massage therapy can help you sustain an erection, last longer in bed, and have a more intense orgasm. Sound too good to be true? It\u2019s not, actually.\n\nWhen done correctly, prostatic massage comes with very little risks and no side effects.\n\nIt\u2019s an almost foolproof way to treat erectile dysfunction. Are you ready to begin the journey back to a rock-hard erection? Let\u2019s get going.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Prostate Massage: The Ultimate Guide to Please the Male G-Spot\n\n\n\nDid you ever come across the so-called prostate massage? Have you ever had the feeling that there are different types of orgasms in a male body? Or have you as a woman ever heard about giving a prostate massage to let your partner experience deeper full-body orgasms without ejaculation?\n\nIf so, you\u2019ve come to the right article to learn more about prostate stimulation, prostate massage, or prostate milking.\n\nWe can define prostate massage as any form of stimulation directed to the prostate gland in a male body, be it for health or erotic reasons.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIt\u00b4s a gland that serves one main purpose: generating a lubrication liquid that will help to preserve the sperm and boost its mobility if ejaculation occurs.\n\nThe prostate is located to either side of the urethra, just below the bladder, and in front of the rectum. It has that strategic location at the beginning of your urethra so it can distribute its lubrication liquid all along the length of your penis at the moment of ejaculation.\n\nLet\u2019s highlight that the prostate does not store sperm.\n\nThe prostate liquid is completely translucid, and it\u2019s sort of an additive to the seminal mix that is expelled through ejaculation.\n\nWhen you ejaculate, both your seminal vesicles and your prostate experience contractions that pressurize the respective liquids inside them. Sperm is shot out of the vesicles, and lubrication is shot out of the prostate gland, just a few fractions of seconds before sperm is released. Kind of to make way for the whole ejaculation fluid that will combine and shoot out through your urethra.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nThat\u2019s why the term prostate milking is actually misguiding: most practices of prostate massage aim to trigger contractions of the gland, but since men are so used to link the contractions of the prostate with the ejaculatory process, most of the time their seminal vesicles will also be triggered to expel its sperm mix.\n\nThe term \u201cmilking the prostate\u201d comes from the white color that the ejaculatory fluid obtained through this kind of prostate stimulation. An authentic \u201cdraining\u201d of the prostate gland, though, should result in a 100% transparent liquid, since it\u2019s only sperm from the seminal vesicles that\u2019s responsible for a white color in any expelled fluids.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nSome medical doctors and alternative practitioners alike suggest that prostate massage is a good idea to treat inflammation in the gland, especially when it\u2019s caused by non-bacterial factors. Swelling of the prostate, also known as prostatitis, can be caused by infections, nerve damage, and abnormal behavior of the cells associated with emotional, genetic and sexual-activity or sexual-abstinence factors.\n\nThe theory behind the health benefits of a prostate massage is that by producing contractions that stimulate the deep tissue of the gland, and draining any stale liquid that may have been stored inside one of its creases, the inflammation of the whole prostate can be stopped, and \u2013 over a few sessions of massage with the right technique \u2013 completely stopped.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nMany men, particularly straight men who had never experienced any form of perineal or rectal stimulation, find that the practice of prostate massage offers them an entrance to a much deeper and more intense dimension of sexual pleasure.\n\nThe reason behind this is that our culture trains men to discover pleasure in a very shallow way, very often quite dependent on porn, too. Hard, fast and furious stroking of the penis leads to a superficial experience of orgasm.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nIf you think about it, most men talk about masturbation as a means to release stress, rather than to explore different ways of enhancing their capacity for pleasure. Prostate massage thus represents a door to breaking the pattern of shallow, quick orgasms, and incorporate new, whole-body sensations to the map of pleasure possibilities in your body.\n\nThe value of erotic prostate massage is that you learn to interpret different forms of pleasure.\n\nThose involve different nerves of your body and take the focus away from the traditional penis-only stimulation.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nThere are three different ways in which you can practice prostate stimulation. Each of them has different perks and also different challenges, so it\u2019s good to have a clear overview of what they offer and under which scenarios they may be the best option for you to explore.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nThis form of prostate stimulation is a great way to introduce yourself to the art of consciously involving your prostate gland in the experience of pleasure.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t involve introducing a finger or a toy into your rectum, so while it might not provide the intensity in sensations that is offered by the direct stimulation of the prostate, it\u2019s also gentler when you have been used to a single form of erotic stimulation for so many years.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nIt consists of applying pressure to different points of your perineum, the area of skin and muscular tissue between your testicles and your anus, as well as the area above your pubic bone. Both areas are in contact with internal tissue that will indirectly stimulate your prostate gland, and thus expand your erotic sensibility from just the shaft of your penis to your whole complex of inner sex organs.\n\nAlthough you can do a relaxing massage without any further goals, an erotic component to it will add more depth the experience. Combining prostate stimulation with stroking the penis can be a good form to enhance the sensations for this external variety of the massage.\n\nThe pressure you apply to your perineum or just above your pubic bone can take the form of circle massaging, rubbing back and forth, or even just pinpointing specific areas that feel good to you as you press.\n\nYou may want to practice the external prostate massage while you\u2019re lying on your bed, either on your back or your side, keeping your legs flexed towards your butt, since it\u2019s the position that allows a better relaxation of the pelvic area, and it also gives you space to work around your perineum.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nThe amount of pressure and the speed of your movements can vary according to your personal preferences, so you have to be patient and keep an open mind while you experiment and get used to all the new, different sensations\u2026\n\nIt may take a while until you identify just the kind movements that you enjoy the most.\n\nExpanding your awareness of pleasure to the inner regions of your penis will not only increase the intensity of your orgasms but also its duration since activating the nerve endings that surround the prostate will make the natural contractions of the gland go on for longer.\n\nHealth-wise, some of the potential benefits of increasing the strength and frequency of prostate stimulation can also be obtained through this indirect form of massage, but the more advanced practitioners of prostate stimulation still recommend the direct stimulation of the gland to see clearer effects in the treatment of prostatitis.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nThe position of the prostate gland makes it quite easy to be reached by applying pressure with a finger or a sex toy to the inner front wall of the rectum, about 2 to 3 inches from the entrance.\n\nA direct stimulation of the gland allows a more thorough relaxation of the tissue through the massaging motion, so for those health professionals who prescribe this practice as a remedy against prostatitis, the inner prostate stimulation through the rectum is the recommended choice.\n\nIn terms of erotic exploration, the direct massage to the prostate also offers one main advantage: the unprecedented nature of the sensations that may be discovered through the practice, which can offer a fresh perspective into expanding your horizons of sensual pleasure.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nIf you want to give yourself a prostate massage, the best time for it would be during a time of the day where your bowels are empty, so you feel more relaxed and have no worries about mixed sensations while exploring the inside of your rectum.\n\nIf you want, you can take a bath or a shower just before you start the practice, since you\u2019ll feel the whole area is cleaner, and the hot water will also help to relax your whole body.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that fecal matter is never stored in your rectum: it only passes through that last portion of your intestines at the moment your sphincter opens to relieve yourself. The sphincter itself, though, is located more than 4 inches inside the bowel, so there is no risk of accidentally \u201cdigging up\u201d something you don\u2019t want to be handling.\n\nThe whole area, though, does have feces residues, so if you are very conscious about that, you can always choose to put on a latex glove to perform the massage.\n\nWe suggest that you try the massage lying on your bed, in a position that allows you to have your legs as flexed as it\u2019s comfortable for you. This will help you keep maintain both your pelvic floor and your rectum much more relaxed, which is key to activating sensitivity in the area.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nIf you\u2019re in a relationship where you trust your partner and you feel comfortable asking them to try the massage together, then manual stimulation is surely the best way to start, since fingers allow for a much more precise stimulation of different parts of the prostate.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to try the massage on your own, the best position will probably be lying on your side on the bed, with your knees flexed towards your chest. Even in this position, however, you may find that it\u2019s not so easy for your fingers to reach 2 to 3 inches inside your rectum.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, you may want to buy a prostate stimulator to make the whole experience effortless. We\u2019ll give you a few tips on selecting the best sex toy for this purpose in the next section.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nOnce you\u2019ve found the position in which you feel the most comfortable, start by doing a gentle massage of the whole perineal region, and then slowly start moving towards your anus. Make sure to spend at least 5 minutes relaxing the muscles that surround the anal area, because otherwise, the entrance to your rectum will feel uncomfortable to touch.\n\nYou will have to be very patient, anyway, since all sensations will be new and there might be some feelings of uneasiness as you discover the most pleasurable way to stimulate your prostate. If you\u2019re trying the massage with a partner, a lot of feedback during the whole process will make all the difference in the world.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nMake sure to have a lubricant at hand, and to use it generously. Coconut oil doubles as a good massage lubricant for the external muscles of the perineum, and the inner stimulation of the prostate. If you prefer a factory-made alternative, you can find anal lubricant in every sex shop.\n\nTo enter the rectum with your finger, you can start by a circular massage to open the anal orifice very gently. We recommend using your index finger because it\u2019s the one that will give you more accuracy finding the right angle to stimulate the prostate from inside.\n\nYou need to insert it with the palm of your hand towards your testicles, not towards your butt since you\u2019ll have to press your finger towards the front of your rectum in order to reach the prostate.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nSlide your finger very slowly, and take deep and conscious breaths the whole time, to keep your body relaxed and receptive to the experience. You\u00b4ll probably need to slide your finger into the second knuckle or a little bit deeper. You can do circular motions in different directions, to look for the right spot to reach your prostate.\n\nYou\u2019ll know that you\u00b4ve found it because the sensation will be different.\n\nNot pleasurable from the start, perhaps, but clearly different than touching the rest of the area. Keep in mind that you won\u2019t exactly touch the prostate: you\u2019ll rather be using the pressure against the rectal wall to transmit the stimulation to the prostate gland.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nDon\u2019t place any expectations on the massage the first time. Orgasm will be great when it happens, but don\u2019t be in a rush to get to that finish line.\n\nThe most valuable part of an inner prostate massage is that you\u2019ll amplify your erotic arsenal to sensations that are completely independent of your penis. At first, you might not recognize that you\u2019re walking into different realms of pleasure, but if you are consistent with the stimulation you\u2019ll start to notice some signs of sexual energy building up.\n\nThe first one might be some contractions in different areas surrounding the spot of the massage. You may also experience a warm sensation in your whole pelvic area, or a sense of \u201cbeing full\u201d in your lower abdomen. Play along with the sensations and allow yourself to enjoy them.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nIf you feel like you need to pee at any moment, you can stop and see if you actually have a full bladder. If the urge to go disappears when your finger is at rest, then most likely you don\u2019t really need to pee\u2026 it\u2019s just the sensation of your engorged prostate applying some pressure to your urethra and your bladder.\n\nAs long as you stay relaxed and enjoy the building up of pressure and muscle movements, a new and deeper kind of orgasm will surprise you sooner or later. It might not happen on the very first session because different men have different prostatic sensibility, but if you keep on trying and enjoying the practice, you\u2019ll catch up with this reward of a new version of climax for sure.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing prostate stimulation on your own, and you don\u2019t feel comfortable enough reaching in with your index finger, then you should definitely explore using a prostate massager.\n\nOne of the most recommended brands are Lelo and Aneros, and our advice is to go for one of the smaller, simpler models. Anything with a vibrator might be effective to speed up the journey towards the climax, but it\u2019s better if you start with a non-vibrating device to be able to identify the subtler sensations that surround prostate stimulation.\n\nOtherwise, you may find yourself completely dependent on the power of electric vibration to enjoy any form of prostate massage.\n\nTantus Prostate Play\n\nAneros\n\nNjoy Pfun Plug\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nThe last form of prostate stimulation is the one we advise the most to take up as a regular practice. You can activate intense contractions of the prostate gland if you master the ability to have deeper, whole-body orgasms that do not involve ejaculation.\n\nThese kind of orgasms are possible when you learn to circulate your sexual energy beyond your pelvic area, while your penis continues to be stimulated (via a handjob, blowjob, or regular intercourse).\n\nIn Tantric sex, this is a highly encouraged practice, as the ability to reach climax without the need to ejaculate allows you to save a lot of vital energy. And by saving up the energy that you would normally lose by ejaculating, you can boost your health, your capacity to experience pleasure, and even your sex skills as you learn to develop a more perceptive personality as a lover.\n\nAll the benefits you can get from direct or indirect prostate massage can also be obtained through this third option of non-ejaculatory orgasms. However, in order to develop the awareness of your inner flow of sexual energy, direct or indirect prostate massage can actually be a really helpful experience.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nA lot of the men who happened to learn Tantra or train themselves in the Tantric arts to experience whole-body, non-ejaculatory orgasms, have a really hard time at first taking the focus of pleasure off from the penis to extend it to the rest of the body. So it\u2019s no surprise that some of them are convinced that giving prostate massage a try was the turning point to develop their ability to experience inner, deeper, non-ejaculatory orgasms.\n\nSome men are lucky enough to experience a non-ejaculatory orgasm the very first time they try prostate massage. Most guys, however, will find that the intensity of a prostate massage will also trigger a regular ejaculation (perhaps with a more abundant emission of semen, and of course with deeper and more powerful sensations in different parts of the body, but still, all linked to same plain old ejaculation).\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nThere is of course nothing wrong with a mind-blowing ejaculatory orgasm, just as there\u2019s nothing wrong if you\u2019re one of the lucky few to get to \u201cdry\u201d climaxes through prostate stimulation. But, in the long term, both practices are a little taxing on your body. The first one because of a large amount of vital energy that is drained from the body through ejaculation; the second, because of the irritation that can be caused in the rectal walls if you practice prostate massage too regularly, especially if you discover you enjoy really long sessions.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nThat\u2019s why, if you are delighted with the enhanced experiences of orgasm that you achieved thanks to prostate stimulation, we can\u2019t recommend enough that you also have a try at exploring the art of Tantra for men. We have an amazing course just on that subject, with world-class expert Eyal Matsliah, in case you want to go deeper.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents\n\nThe decision to open up to the experience of prostate stimulation is a very personal one, of course, but from our perspective, it is something every man should be willing to consider for the sake of their ultimate erotic fulfillment.\n\nIn addition to the health benefits that are associated with it, so many folks have found that it is one of the most fun variations they can add to their sexual repertoire, either by themselves or with a partner.\n\nThe practice, if performed safely and in a moderated frequency, is completely safe, and it, of course, has nothing to do with sexual orientation as both heterosexual and homosexual men report that it has enhanced their sex lives next to either a female or male partner.\n\nSo don\u2019t let any resistance get in the way of your discovery of new sexual sensations.\n\nAfter all, we\u2019ve shown you that you have three very different options to incorporate prostate sensitivity into your erotic possibilities and skills.\n\nSo just give the inner or outer prostate massage a try, and if you feel that\u2019s not your calling, you can always explore the benefits of prostate stimulation, both for therapy and pleasure purposes, via the more subtle way of cultivating Tantric skills to revolutionize your whole potential as a lover.\n\n\u2026back to table of contents<|endoftext|>"}

That\u2019s right: pussy!\n\nVaginas are, without argument, one of the universe\u2019s most incredible gifts.\n\nThey double as the path to life for much of humanity and the main source of feminine pleasure. As both a pussy owner and fan, I suggest we celebrate this sacred energy center for its powerful contribution to existence.\n\nIf you love lady bits as much as I do, then pussy worship could be right up your alley.\n\nJust like cock worship, this ancient practice enjoys a long history in cultures around the world. It can be a healing ritual for both givers and receivers. In this article, we\u2019ll explore pussy worship and how you can make it a divine experience.\n\nPussy worship is about far more than trying to make your partner come. Sexual pleasure is a divine experience in itself, but the most important thing here is that their feminine spirit feels deeply adored, valued, and recognized.\n\nIf they come while you worship, cool! If not, no worries because that\u2019s not your prime objective.\n\nYou also don\u2019t want to worship with the expectation they\u2019ll return the favor. Sexual acts are seen by some as an obligatory exchange. However, your partner will be able to sense this attitude, making it difficult for them to enjoy.\n\nForget the expectation that they should do something for you as follow-up. Pussy worship is all about giving!\n\nMany pussy owners have baggage and hang-ups related to their sweet pink bits. Perhaps porn or a past partner have led them to believe their pussy is too hairy, musky, or voluptuous. If they\u2019ve experienced sexual assault in the past, they might also attach that terrifying and dehumanizing memory to their genitalia.\n\nMaybe they look in the mirror and think, \u201cWhy would I ever want anyone looking at or touching me there?\u201dAs expected, beliefs like this will impede their ability to enjoy with you, even if you think their pussy is incredible!\n\nBeing conscious of their feelings will allow you to worship with awareness and possibly help heal some deeply hidden emotional wounds.\n\nSo, have a chat sometime before your pussy-worship ritual. Hold space for them to speak while you listen. Even just feeling heard about this topic could mean the world to your partner.\n\nYou\u2019ll miss the entire point of pussy worship if you\u2019re caught up in worries about your to-do list or catching your favorite sitcom. Schedule your session for when you and your partner can relax and won\u2019t have any pressing matters to attend to.\n\nThat way you\u2019ll be able to dive in and luxuriate. Also, your partner won\u2019t feel like they have to perform or fake their pleasure for your sake.\n\nWhile your kitchen countertop or the backseat of a car may be hot places to get your fuck on, they\u2019re not ideal settings for a pussy worship ritual.\n\nYou want to craft an atmosphere that\u2019s comfortable for both you and your partner.\n\nHeat up the room where you plan to hold your ritual in advance. When you\u2019re ready to get started, have your partner lie somewhere soft, like on a bed or sofa, while wearing their blanket or sarong to start.\n\nThen, use a few pillows to get them into a position that feels good and gives you unimpeded access to their pussy. Some people feel better when their knees, hips, or head are elevated.\n\nAsk questions and make adjustments until you both find what works best.\n\nNext, set the mood with candles, aromatherapy, music, or whatever makes you both feel good. You\u2019ll have a much better time if the vibe is just to your liking.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to be in the moment to worship pussy mindfully. Let go of thoughts about the past and future and make the powerful energy of your partner\u2019s Yoni your focus. Think about every part of their Yoni, such as the inner and outer labia, the hood of their clit, or the changing color of their skin.\n\nTune them in while tuning out distractions.\n\nPussy gazing is a hypnotizing, wonderful way to get in the zone as you begin your session. Stare at your partner\u2019s pussy and the surrounding area with reverence. Allow yourself to lock into a devoted trance.\n\nAlso, make eye contact with your partner at certain points throughout the process. Though it may make both of you feel vulnerable, eye contact is proven to deepen feelings of intimacy. Allow yourself to be seen and help your partner feel seen and accepted exactly as they are.\n\nYour partner won\u2019t know how you feel during the experience unless you tell them. Let them know how much you love the taste, smell, look or feeling of their pussy. You could even create art or write a poem about it!\n\nThis kind of adulation and specific praise could end up staying with your partner forever.\n\nSit in front of your partner and place your right hand on their pussy while placing your left hand over their heart. Feel the connection between these two centres and visualize the energy of their heart running down your arm to their Yoni.\n\nHold this position for as long as it feels good. This will help your partner feel grounded and tune into your touch during your session.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get handsy! But rather than diving in and going for gold right away, start by lightly touching and massaging the area around your partner\u2019s pussy, like their thighs and stomach. Move inward gradually, finally reaching their pubis, labia, clit, vagina, perineum, (and anus too, if they\u2019re into that).\n\nExplore like a curious pioneer roving new lands!\n\nCaress, massage, lick, kiss, pinch, and whatever else your partner could enjoy. Notice their reactions and how they respond to your ministrations.\n\nFeedback will help you become an expert in no time. Put on your silkiest, sexiest voice and ask your partner how it feels when you touch them like this or that. Find out if they\u2019d like more or less of something.\n\nThen, zero in on your most effective techniques and watch them float off into bliss.\n\nAs you continue, up the ante by applying more pressure, speeding up your movements, or changing your technique. Don\u2019t worry if your partner becomes less vocal or outwardly aroused. They could simply be transitioning into a quieter headspace or building toward orgasm.\n\nPussy worship is pretty much guaranteed to turn you on. Don\u2019t be afraid to express your enjoyment! When I\u2019m receiving, I have a way better time if I\u2019m confident that my partner is genuinely enjoying the experience rather than considering it a chore.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to be self-conscious about your own noises or reactions during the ritual. Feel free to let go.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ll both decide to finish up if your partner comes. Or, maybe they won\u2019t come at all and will simply feel sated anyway at some point. Maybe they\u2019ll come multiple times and beg you for more! No matter what happens, encourage your partner to be open about how long they\u2019d like to keep going.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to be aware of your boundaries as the giver.\n\nPussy worship can be exhausting after a while. If you begin to feel tired, slowly wind down and bring the session to an end.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve finished, cover your partner with a blanket and give them time to absorb what they\u2019ve just experienced. As they do, take this time to meditate next to them, observing whatever feelings or sensations arise within you as the giver.\n\nThe more you practice, the better the experience will be each time!\n\nRegular pussy worship rituals can turn into a serious bonding activity, adding amazing depth to your sexual interactions and overall relationship.\n\nThe time has come to stop attaching shame to our bodies and revere our amazing genitals in all their glory. You can fight the good fight and boost intimacy with your partner by adding the art of pussy worship to your sexual menu.<|endoftext|>"}

The gun smoke clears, and it turns out there is money \u2014 and lots of it.\n\nThe music scene explodes with jazz clubs, and naughty speakeasies are making a fortune selling illegal booze. Women get paid more and finally can vote, which helps them claim their power.\n\nThe sexual revolution of the Roaring 20s begins \u2014 and here are 7 spicy ingredients that made this cocktail stronger than any Negroni you ever had.\n\nFashion itself was as much a character in the Roaring 20s as the bold people that wore it \u2014 especially women.\n\nThey were ready to show their best moves on the dancefloor, so they ditched the grandma\u2019s pantaloons and corsets for light bras and lingerie. The party dresses became shorter and more playful. The sleeves, waistline, and neckline dropped, and way more skin got revealed.\n\nThe knit swimwear and women\u2019s sportswear, like tennis clothes, empowered more women to do sports. And Coco Chanel \u2013 who was quite a rascal herself \u2013 created a new, more boyish, silhouette with her \u201clittle black dress.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be honest \u2014 who doesn\u2019t like a bit of a Gatsby-style, sexy dress-up party?\n\nSince bare arms had replaced bearing arms, all this free-form fashion made dance the natural expression of the post-war hedonism.\n\nIt was an era of Jazz, and the most popular dances \u2014 the Charleston and the Black Bottom \u2014 encouraged a loosening of the body and all kinds of cheeky moves.\n\nPart of what made this youthful mingling so naughty and exciting was minimal supervision and \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 alcohol. Before WWI, the majority of the \u201cfun time out\u201d would be with family or at church events, usually segregated by gender. Oh, joy!\n\n\u201cIn the 1920s, a new woman was born. She smoked, drank, danced, and voted.\nShe cut her hair, wore makeup, and went to petting parties.\nShe was giddy and took risks. She was a flapper.\u201d\n\u2013 Jennifer Rosenberg\n\nFlappers sported high heels, intense makeup (like rouge, lipstick, and mascara), and short hairstyles like the bob.\n\nPeople in the Roaring 20s were smoking and swearing. They were cheeky and playful \u2014 not only with men but also with each other.\n\nThey invented the concept of dating and broke away from the Victorian image of womanhood.\n\nWith their sexiness and sass, they were not only scary and offensive to many men, but also to older feminists. Why? They saw their taboo-breaking ways a disregard of all for which the suffragettes had fought for. Beef alert!\n\nBut if the \u201cofficial feminism\u201d seemed less important to the Flappers, this was because these young women were struggling for freedom and identity in their personal lives.\n\nIdeas of duty, sacrifice, and the greater good had been debunked by the WWI \u2014 and this generation started to explore how to be true to one\u2019s self, not to a cause.\n\nThat\u2019s a big one. Challenging conventions, sex educators like Marie Stopes, Margaret Sanger, or Mary Ware Dennett risked arrest over and over again. As the law prohibited the distribution of information about sex, including birth control devices and other \u201carticles of immoral use.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t give up, and over time, their determination, along with their provocative behavior, wore down the public stigma around sex and even sexual experimentation before marriage.\n\nBirth control became more widely available, at least for more privileged ladies.\n\nThis helped limit family size and gave women the freedom to explore their sexuality without facing the consequences of unwanted pregnancies.\n\nCinema and cars \u2014 thanks, Mr. Ford! \u2014 became more popular and accessible in the Roaring 20s than ever before. This provided young people with a new sense of privacy.\n\nMotion pictures and theater capitalized on the public\u2019s growing acceptance of heterosexual flirtation and romance. They spread some daring ideas and cheeky practices from cities to smaller towns.\n\nOne of the actresses who shaped and lived the sassy vibe of the 20s was Louise Brooks. Her iconic bob became the must-have hairstyle for modern ladies. It became famous when Louise played a sexually inhibited femme fatale in the silent movie Pandora\u2019s box.\n\nThe charming 1920s at its best!\n\nWhen Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d was published, the vibrant atmosphere of the decade had already rapidly transformed, and our bold women had integrated themselves more into society.\n\nThey were dressing differently, smoking, drinking (despite it being illegal).\n\nThe knew how to obtain financial aid independently and were competing with men in the business world. You bet all of this threatened the traditional concept of masculinity!\n\nThe novel itself was centered around a male main character. However, it also approached femininity in such a way that it challenged all of the previous misconceptions concerning women. One of the most significant cultural taboos was: adultery.\n\nDuring this time in the U.S., it was kinda acceptable for well-born men to have affairs because of their power and status in society). But not for the ladies!\n\nIt was seen very shameful, almost barbaric when women were caught cheating on their husbands. But not the other way around. Hello, double standards!\n\nEver heard of him? That\u2019s the dude that put sex on the map.\n\nWell, he didn\u2019t get everything right. For example, he didn\u2019t understand female sexuality too well. He thought that the clitoral orgasm was nonessential except as a warm-up for the more important, vaginal orgasm. Oh, dear! How about we send him to the Female Orgasm Online Course?\n\nBut he did nail quite a few crucial things:\n\nLet this inspire you to start your own sexual revolution in your bedroom and overall life this decade.

Tantric techniques are designed to use sexual energy to reach higher or altered states of consciousness.\n\nIn other words, sacred sex brings the physical act of lovemaking to a whole new realm of highly pleasurable and powerful mind-body connections with your partner.\n\nSo, what are the features that make sacred sexuality a thing? Well as you may have guessed already, it goes way beyond just your intimate bits.\n\nSacred sex is more about enriching sensual pleasure, and feeling pleasure from every molecule of your soul.\n\nIt is also important to note that sacred sexuality is accessible to everyone, not just those who have studied Tantra.

Read on to discover what makes sacred sex so awesome and how to take your sex to a whole new mind-blowing level.\n\nDid you know that just by getting more comfortable with your most intimate bits can rev up your sex life? Psychotherapist and Certified Sex Therapist, Gila Shapiro says that \u201cHow you feel about your body affects your ability to express yourself sexually.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the fear that we have about our bodies never being attractive enough can really put a serious damper on our sex life. Makes sense right?\n\nSo, how do you and your partner connect with your sacred sexuality and vital force? Well, you can start by healing your wounds with Yoni Self Massage.\n\nBy giving attention and unconditional love to the most sacred and powerful part of our bodies, we can free ourselves of past traumas, limiting beliefs and any feeling of disconnection to our core.\n\nTry Self Yoni Massage with an open mind (and an open heart, as well). You will seriously be amazed by all the vibrant changes for growth and pleasure it brings into the different areas of your life.\n\nAs a result, the more self-acceptance you have about your own sexuality, the more deeply you will connect to your partner in bed.\n\nOkay, while eye-gazing may feel a bit awkward or woo-woo at first think of it like an experiment and go into it with an open heart and mind. Soul or Eye-Gazing is a way of non-verbally communicating with your partner in a very sacred way.\n\nIt can open up new doors to intimacy and harmonize the energy of both partners. Moreover, it\u2019s really easy to get started too!\n\nA simple exercise can involve you and your partner sitting cross-legged in the bed (ideally with little or no clothing) and begin to gaze deeply into each other\u2019s eyes.\n\nWhen the juices start flowing below (don\u2019t worry if they don\u2019t just yet) keep that sexy eye-gazing going when you start to get heavy between the sheets!\n\nRegardless of what happens, keeping that sultry eye-contact is the secret ingredient that\u2019ll bring spice and depth to our love-life. Want more of where that came from? Check out Why Keeping Eye Contact During Sex Makes It So Much Better!\n\nNow that your sensual bits are feeling good, take it one step further by incorporating some sensual conscious touch. Conscious touch is one of the tantric secrets of sacred sex.\n\nSome even say that conscious touch can be one of the most nurturing and healing touches out there.\n\nTo boot, it can be super arousing. And, it\u2019s really easy to do! Just take a moment to connect with your heart.\n\nFrom there, begin to tune into your body (ask your partner to do the same) and start to slowly touch each other. Touch with the highest awareness, appreciation, and fascination you know.\n\nNext, ask yourself where on my body do I love to be touched? How does it want to be massaged caressed etc? Take turns exploring each other\u2019s bodies just like this.\n\nKeep in mind that conscious touch is not about jumping right into sex, but more about connecting on a soul and physical level.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, is that science also says touch is a vital part of human well-being.\n\nIn fact, a study conducted in the Division of Dermatology at the University of California San Diego Medical Center in 2012 showed that touch raises oxytocin levels and reduces the secretion of a stress hormone that is basically like nature\u2019s built-in alarm system.\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, conscious touch not only relaxes the body but can reinforce the psychological bond between you and your current partner. So, ow that you have incorporated a little bit of conscious touch, congrats!\n\nYou are a few steps closer to experiencing sacred sexuality and a deeper connection with your partner. But wait, there\u2019s more\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s so much potential for spiritual discovery with the incorporation of some sacred sex positions. A heavenly sacred sex position called the Yab-Yum promotes a mind-body connection between both partners.\n\nThe Yab-Yum position is where the woman sits in a man\u2019s lap while he is cross-legged and she wraps her legs around his waist.\n\nIdeally, both partners\u2019 arms are also embracing each other. Yab-Yum is the symbol of divine union.\n\nIt is a posture in which man and women are united between heaven and earth.\n\nFurthermore, the Yab-Yum Tantric sacred sex position can be used as mediation to help align chakras and promote energy flow through both bodies.\n\nA couple may sit in a Yab-Yum with or without clothes and it can involve penetration or not. Incorporating the Yab-Yum position is a beautiful way and sacred way to make love, but certainly not the only way. Let\u2019s explore more.\n\nWant to know one of the best features of sacred sex? Delayed orgasm.\n\nOh, but cum on you say! Aren\u2019t orgasms the best part of sex? Wrong! In fact, what makes sex truly sacred is actually everything that happens between now and the finish line. And guess what?\n\nTaoists believe that when the woman, or your partner, is turned on and properly satisfied, even more of this life essence, called \u201cjing,\u201d is created.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, is that you may even find that delayed orgasm is better than sex. The easiest way to practice this is by \u201cteasing\u201d your partner. You can do this by bringing your partner to the edge of orgasm, and then pulling back.\n\nThink of it as a dance between two feathers, using your mouth, fingers or whatever part of your body to practice light, yet intentional touch.\n\nTake turns flirting with your partner\u2019s nether regions and then keep riding the wave of in-between-pleasure.\n\nUltimately, if you are really trying to sacredly connect to your partner on a sacred level, hone in on some sultry foreplay and hold the explosion. It will be worth the wait.\n\nIf you can\u2019t get enough of sacred sex, you can try adding a few more things to your holy-moly sex life. While orgasm is not necessarily the end-goal of sacred sex between you and your partner you can choose to practice orgasm healing.\n\nOrgasm healing has actually been proven to induce a sexual-like trance.\n\nIn fact, Neuroscientist and PhD candidate at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, Adam Safron says that rhythmical sexual stimulation, if intense enough, can quite literally launch you into an altered state of mind.\n\nBAM \u2013 just like that! In other words, a full-body orgasm can be similar to an involuntary reflex, where all of your focus is on the present sensation. And, as a result, this type of orgasm can quite literally throw you into a euphoric dream-like state.\n\nWow, awesome, don\u2019t you think? Aside from throwing you into a sexual trance, full-body orgasms can benefit women and men alike.\n\nFull-body orgasms, for both males and females, are shown to reduce stress due to the surge of oxytocin, the so-called \u201ccuddle hormone,\u201d that occurs with orgasm.\n\nYep, it\u2019s true! A study conducted in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of North Carolina in 2004 showed that having sex and orgasms along with more warm contact increases levels of the hormone oxytocin.\n\nConsequently, this so-called love hormone helps us bond and build trust. So next time you want to give a little sacred boost in your relationship, try this: more eye-contact, more sensual touching, more healing orgasms!\n\nSo there you have it. Sacred sexuality isn\u2019t just for spiritual gurus living in conscious communities in the woods. It\u2019s actually quite accessible and exciting, right?\n\nIf you can apply some of the features listed above, then you are on your way to an enlightened path to deeper and sexier connection with your partner. Now get out there and ride that sacred wave!<|endoftext|>"}

However, studies have shown that sex alleviates stress and tension, and enhances your intimacy. We think you know where we\u2019re going with this\u2026\n\nYes, have sex!\n\nWe get it, it\u2019s hard to find the time and get in the mood with kids around. Still, know that making your love life a priority is very important. Your happiness and relationship satisfaction are on the line here.\n\nSo, here are a few suggestions on how you can have sex after kids.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard this plenty of times, but we gotta say it again. Don\u2019t just \u201cfind\u201d the time for sex. Make it!\n\nSchedule the time, put it in your calendar, and turn on an alarm if necessary. So what that having sex feels like an appointment\u2013\u2013it\u2019s a sexy appointment!\n\nOnce you have some time scheduled, the fun doesn\u2019t wait till then! Tease one another until the moment comes.\n\nHow about sending a quick nude while you\u2019re in the bathroom? Or shooting a saucy message about what you want to get up to later? Get the heart rate going and naughty thoughts racing. Just try not to rip each other\u2019s clothes when the time comes.\n\nPrivacy is a big one when you are trying to have sex after kids. So, having a few rules in place will help you feel a little more secure when it\u2019s time to turn up the heat.\n\nA scheduled bedtime is a literal life savior for parents. It allows you to do the stuff you considered normal before having kids such as reading, choosing your own TV shows to watch, and\u2026 getting frisky!\n\nIf your kids love finding an excuse to sleep in your bed, try out the \u201cback to bed\u201d rule. They might be allowed to fall asleep next to you but once they do, you\u2019ll carry them back to their beds.\n\nGetting a lock for your bedroom door will allow you to have a safe haven for when you want to indulge in sexy play. If your kids are old enough, you can also introduce a policy that respects closed doors all around the house.\n\nThis might not be for tired parents, for whom sleep is sacred.\n\nBut if you have a normal sleeping schedule and it\u2019s the weekend, a morning romp might be exactly what you need.\n\nSet an alarm so you could wake up before the kids and dedicate your morning to some nourishing sensuality. Self-pleasure is a go, as well as mutual masturbation.\n\nFeeling cuddly? Get your partner involved in a sexy spooning session. Cuddling can easily turn into humping, which can quickly escalate into some passionate play.\n\nIt\u2019s all about making the best of your time. So don\u2019t shy away from quickies!\n\nIf you need an excuse to disappear, say that you\u2019re doing chores, having an important meeting, or taking a much needed afternoon nap. And once the door is locked, get down to it!\n\nNext to sex after kids, also check out our 5 sex positions to try around the house.\n\nOf course, vulva owners might find this a little more difficult to get into as they usually need more time to warm up. If that\u2019s the case, arrange so that mommy could leave a little earlier and get warmed up on her own. Moms deserve longer afternoon naps, alright?\n\nBathrooms are great. Why? Cause they have a lock and they allow you to mask any suspicious noise by turning on the shower.\n\nSo, once in a while, turn your shower routine into a sexy routine.\n\nAllow things to get hot and steamy by rubbing shower gel onto your own body or your partner\u2019s bodies. Saving water and minutes? Yes, please!\n\nPelvic floor exercises are a great way to strengthen the vulva and penis, and they result in stronger orgasms for when you do have some privacy.\n\nDo them any time of day and in any scenario.

Well, here\u2019s an idea: get yourselves out of the bedroom. One study found that people having sex around the house are 33% more satisfied with their sex life than those only having sex in bed, with 10.5% more satisfied overall in their relationships.\n\nThat\u2019s some pretty exciting statistics, especially when all you have to do is explore the house. Yet, it can seem pretty daunting when many of us are so used to the bed\u2026 Agreed, it\u2019s comfortable, and it\u2019s the right size and shape for your bodies to do their thing. How on earth would sex in the kitchen or the bathroom work? There are just so many obstacles\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019ve got you covered. With these five positions, for outside the bedroom, you\u2019ll become the master of the house, and of your relationship.\n\nTo get warmed up, why not fantasize about which room you\u2019d most like to do it in. You could have a solo masturbation session in said room. Dirty talk or sext your partner about how you couldn\u2019t help yourself and that you need to explore every single room together! Set a date, or a few, to try out each room and add props to the mix to take it to the next level\u2013\u2013making it a sexy Cluedo if you will.\n\nThough this is in your home office, this is 100% Not Safe For Work. Just make sure your conference webcam is switched off. The Captain is a perfect position enjoyed on a desk\u2013\u2013whether you want to dramatically throw your paper and pens to the floor as they do in the movies, that is up to you (just remember you\u2019ll have to clear it up afterwards).\n\nIf you are feeling super dominant, grab a wire and tie up the receiver\u2019s hands as they lie on their back, legs in the air\u2013\u2013Spread Eagle style. Penetrate them with your penis or dildo while standing over them to take full control! Show them who\u2019s boss. Grab their ankles and move your hips to hit their G-spot or P-spot.\n\nLying face down over the kitchen counter, have your partner penetrate you from behind with their penis or strap-on. This fiery position will certainly heat up your sex life\u2013\u2013just make sure the cooker isn\u2019t on for your safety!\n\nCommunicate to your partner what thrusting motions you want\u2013\u2013deep, shallow, fast, or slow. This position is perfect for G-spot and P-spot stimulation. To top it off, have your partner grab the spatula for some light, medium, or hard spanking on your perfectly positioned ass cheeks.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want your neighbors to see you through the window, the Double Decker is great for some risque secret sex around the house. Positioned just out of sight, lie on the floor, your partner on top of you, as if you were doing Reverse Cowgirl, but you\u2019re both lying down, back to chest.\n\nThis can be super intimate, holding your partner tightly as you penetrate their vagina or anus.\n\nFor even more sensual intimacy, set the mood by lighting some scented candles. Anyone walking past may spy a dimly lit room, they may hear some strange sounds, but not a person in sight. If your partner does start to moan too inconspicuously, you are in the perfect position to cover their mouth to gag them.\n\nHaving a lazy day? This is the perfect Netflix and Chill position as you cuddle on the sofa together. Drifting in and out of slumber, slowly and gently stroke your partner in all the right places. Things will quickly get passionate, and you barely have to move a muscle!

According to a study by the Georgia State University, about 15% of all marriages are sexless (meaning, the marriage hasn\u2019t seen any action in 6 months or more).\n\nA lot of couples who are in sexless marriages may think it\u2019s normal. The longer you stay with someone, the less sex you\u2019re likely to have. But, there are ways to keep the sex alive, if you\u2019re willing to work on and break down the barriers that have stopped you having sex with your partner in the first place.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the realities of a sexless marriage, and what you need to work on to get sex back on the menu in your relationship.\n\nGoogle knows a\u00a0lot\u00a0about our marriage problems. And the biggest problem the search engine is asked to find answers for?\u00a0Sexless marriages.\n\nThe number of people Googling \u00a0\u201csexless marriage\u201d are three and a half times the number of people searching for \u201cunhappy marriage\u201d and eight times more than \u201cloveless marriage\u201d searches.\n\nIn a 2017 study\u00a0published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, figures showed the average adult enjoys sex 54 times a year.\n\nA sexless marriage develops for a lot of reasons (and not all of them are linked to sex itself).\n\nThink about the beginning of a new relationship. It\u2019s often fuelled by excitement and sex, and there is a scientific reason behind this, too.\n\nAn\u00a0NCBI study\u00a0found a new relationship and the excitement it brings actually activates reward centers in the brain. This boosts a person\u2019s state of euphoria and also increases their pain tolerance. The study also found partners become emotionally dependent on their partner and crave being close to them.\n\nBut then, life kicks in, and the honeymoon phase starts to wear off. And this is where some couples start drifting apart.\n\nWhen a couple starts to drift apart, it\u2019s only natural that they begin to lose their connection as well (both physically and mentally). This can set off a whole chain of events that have adverse effects on the relationship.\n\nBefore you know it, you begin taking each other for granted, and resentment starts to build between you and your partner. This emotional detachment then has a knock-on effect into the bedroom, and a couple\u2019s sex life can become non-existent.\n\nIf you\u2019ve emotionally checked out, your libido will check out with you. A person\u2019s libido can be affected by a bunch of things, like depression and stress. But relationship dissatisfaction is also a big killer.\n\nOkay, this is an awkward one. How do you break it to your partner that your sex life, isn\u2019t really\u00a0doing\u00a0it for you? If the reason you\u2019ve stopped having sex is strictly about you not enjoying sex with each other, then it\u2019s time to rekindle what you both used to enjoy.\n\nSurprisingly, sometimes it\u2019s the men who are losing interest in sex. But again, science has an explanation.\u00a0A recent study found testosterone has been falling steadily in men for decades, so that could at least partially explain why your man has lost his mojo. The most important thing to remember about a sexless marriage is that it is fixable \u2013 with some work.\n\nThe first step in overcoming a sexless marriage is to find out the core reason why you\u2019ve stopped having sex, and how long drought has lasted.\n\nTo fix a sexless marriage, you need to dig deep and find out what root cause is that\u2019s stopped you having sex. The first step is figuring out if the lack of sex is physical or mental?\n\nAnd to figure this out, you need to be as open and honest with your partner as possible. This means laying all of your cards out on the table and having a frank, honest conversation about your sex life.\n\nLeave all the bad feelings and resentment at the door\u2014a respectful conversation is the only way you\u2019ll be able to start your journey of getting your sex back.\n\nStomping around in your house in a passive-aggressive manner, moaning about a lack of sex is only going to make the problem worse. Here are a few core issues you\u2019ll need to tackle in your conversations with your partner.\n\nA lot of relationships have partners who have different sex drives. One might want to have sex every day, while the other only wants to have sex once a week.\n\nThis is\u00a0normal, but you need to know where you both stand with your sex drives, so you don\u2019t resent each other. If your sex drives used to match up, but now one partner has stopped wanting to have sex, talk about it. Try remembering what sex was like before, when things changed and what was going on around that time.\n\nAsk each other:\n\nOnce you\u2019ve scratched the surface of what you both want from each other, sexually, start making time to focus on each other.\n\nHave fun with each other, make an effort to bond, and throw some cheeky flirting in! Don\u2019t be afraid to try new things and set new goals together.\n\nA positive mindset is one of the most powerful weapons you can use to get your sex life back on track.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that your lack of action in the bedroom may be because you\u2019re jumping between your day-to-day lives to the sex itself.\n\nIf you don\u2019t show each other any affection in your daily life, how can you expect your sex life to be on fire?\n\nWe aren\u2019t talking about heavy PDA sessions here. Something as small as holding hands while you\u2019re walking down the street or giving each other a hug when you get home from work is sometimes all it takes. Without these small intimate gestures, sex might feel uncomfortable or even forced for both of you.\n\nTackle this head-on and try increasing the physical intimacy in the relationship. Start small. Instead of jumping immediately to sex, give your partner a kiss when you walk in the front door from work. Or reach out and hold their hand while you\u2019re out at dinner or on a walk. Don\u2019t underestimate the importance of human touch.\n\n(Hey, you might find that kissing and cuddling can be just as enjoyable as sex!)\n\nBe honest with yourself! When was the last time you compared your sex life to your friends? Or your favorite Netflix show? Maybe a movie? Or a magazine article?\n\nComparing your sex life to someone else\u2019s is toxic. Remember, there is no \u201cnormal\u201d amount of times you should be having sex with your partner.\n\nIn social circles, people are frequently asked about the \u201cright number\u201d of times to have sex a month, but what\u2019s important is it\u2019s the right number for you, as a couple. Way too often, when we\u2019re talking to our friends, we\u2019re let to believe that everyone has crazy busy sex lives. And yours should be too.\n\nIf you and your partner are having sex once a fortnight and that works for you, that\u2019s\u00a0all\u00a0that matters. Repeat: Don\u2019t compare. It won\u2019t do anything for you or your sexual relationship with your partner.\n\nIf the first three tips don\u2019t bring back your sex, it might be time to do some soul searching and make some tough decisions about the future of the relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that a sexless marriage doesn\u2019t make you or your partner failures. Sexless marriages are common, and most of the time they can be fixed, but even if it\u2019s beyond repair, don\u2019t label it a failure.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discovered, sexless marriages are often caused by deep-rooted physical or emotional issues, either within the relationship or within yourself.\n\nIf you and your partner don\u2019t see a way forward and you haven\u2019t been able to get your sex (or your relationship spark) back, one option you might want to look at is conscious uncoupling.\n\nConscious uncoupling is a way to thank each other for the time you\u2019ve spent together, and end your marriage in a way that is positive for both of you. It\u2019s a way to move forward and wish each other the best in life while remaining friends.\n\nIf your marriage involves kids, this is one of the best ways to break up without causing too much damage. We put together an article about \u201cWhen to End a Relationship\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s time to break down the stigma that surrounds sexless marriages. After all,\u00a015% of the world\u2019s population\u00a0are currently in one. It\u2019s important how you approach the situation and deal with it and with your partner that will either make or break your relationship.\n\nHaving open, honest conversations with each other and finding the root of why your sex life has dried up is the best way to move forward and overcome a sexless marriage.\n\nApproaching it in a passive-aggressive way and avoiding the problem all together won\u2019t do anything for your sex life \u2013 or your relationship.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>The Beducated Guide to Tantric Massage\n\n\n\nEver fantasized about giving or receiving a sensual tantric massage?\u00a0Well, I have, like at least once a day. So, trust me when I say, you\u2019re not alone. Over the years Tantra has become a trendy topic.\n\nBut did you know that Tantra Massage goes way beyond sex and supernatural breathwork?\n\nAnd while yes, Tantra can indeed bring on a huge sexual release, awareness is key bringing it to the next level. Ultimately a tantra Massage should be a sensual and soul-merging experience.\n\nSo how do you transform an ordinary massage into a magical spiritual-connecting tantric massage?\n\nLuckily we\u2019ve got the rundown on how to tantra-lize your partner (or have them tantra-lize you). Read on for some hot tips and techniques to get you started in the sultry and restorative arena of tantric massage.\n\nTantra Massage is a vast and complex subject making it difficult to define. With that said, it is loosely referred to as a massage that uses sensual touch to awaken or elicit a deeper sense of consciousness.\n\nHuh? You ask? What does that mean exactly? Well, there is a lot of ambiguity as to what Tantra Massage is and isn\u2019t so let\u2019s go ahead and break it down:\n\nTantra doesn\u2019t come wrapped up neatly in a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d definition. If it were up to us (and we think we are pretty educated in the area), Tantra is an ancient spiritual path, a system of self-development in which sexual energies and desires are not suppressed and used for spiritual unfoldment.\n\nContrary to popular belief the practices of Tantra Massage did not originate in India thousands of years ago. In fact, its origins can be traced mainly to the work of a German man named Andro Andreas Roath in 1977 with beliefs based in yoga, bioenergetics, and sexual energy. He is the founder of Diamond Lotus Tantra Lounge and the first Tantra Institute in Germany.\n\nAs Tantra Massage has become more and more trendy, the Western world has reinterpreted its roots into what some refer to \u201cNeo-Tantra\u201d. In other words, many modern-day Tantra Massage practitioners apply ancient spiritual principles in a new age way to promote deep relaxation and connection to sexual vitality.\n\nSounds intriguing right? To be honest, when done right, Tantra Massage is without a doubt a powerful mind-blowing experience. Having said that, now that you know what Tantra Massage is and what it isn\u2019t, let\u2019s dive a bit deeper into the cosmos.\n\nNo, you don\u2019t need to be a devoted follower of an Indian guru to get started. And maybe you don\u2019t want to be. That is to say, perhaps the idea of Tantra seems intimidating. That\u2019s perfectly okay. If you or your partner are not totally convinced by the idea of Tantra but are still interested in learning more, a good place to start is How To Introduce Your Partner to Tantra\n\nIf you are looking for some tips on how to liberate you and your partner into pillow grasping ecstasy, see our Tantra Tassage online course. \u00a0If you are a lingam lover, you can also check out, how to give an out of this world Lingam Massage.\n\nEither way, the key to giving a spectacular tantric massage is to begin reading and collecting tips from experts.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t need to visit or\u00a0enroll in a Tantra Massage to institute to get started, having some knowledge before you jump into the realm of Tantra will be important.\n\nThe second most important step before performing a Tantra Massage is creating an ambience that goes with it.\n\nMassaging under bright fluorescent lights? As you may have already guessed, not-so-sexy.\u00a0We suggest creating a \u201cMassage Temple\u201d.\n\nThat is to say, making sure the room is warm and discreet.\n\nMake sure you cut out a time where no-one from the outside will disturb you. That means cancelling a daily visit from your mom, or the house-cleaner. You can also try embellishing the room with floral scents or burn smooth burning incense.\n\nIf you want to go all-out, you can prepare a bubble-bath for your partner before the massage. Afterwards, have them slip into a sea of soft blankets on the massage table.\n\nWhen we talk about foreplay in regards to Tantra Massage, we are mostly talking about awareness. With awareness comes breathing.\n\nTo put it simply, breathing and connecting to your partner will actually be your foreplay.\n\nWhy is this so important? Well, a lot of lovers jump head first into the physical play without truly \u201cconnecting\u201d beforehand.\n\nThink of Tantra Massage like preparing a special dish for your lover. You have to gather all the ingredients, carefully add them in, tasting the dish periodically. In the end, the goal is to have a carefully crafted feast to spoon feed your lover with intention and love.\n\nSimilarly, during a tantric massage, it is important to remain in the present moment, check in and tune into of all bodily sensations. Encourage your partner to do the same. Oxygen is the \u201cO\u201d in orgasm, so make sure you give your partner and yourself the space to breathe deeply.\n\nWhile it may feel intense or intimidating to practice eye-contact, the effect can be life-transforming.\n\nOnce you have created awareness through breath, and eye contact, you can begin to integrate the following physical techniques.\n\nRemember that Tantra Massage is an energetic massage in which sexual energy is ignited and/or released. By practicing presence throughout the massage, you can begin to awaken the wisdom of both your partner\u2019s body and your own.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that Tantra Massage often activates chakras, especially if you are intentional with the activation.\n\nAs mentioned before, during a Tantra Massage, lovers can learn to bring awareness to the chakras and tune in and embody the element they represent. A great way to do this is to incorporate a \u201cheart\u201d orgasm which is related to the element of air and provokes angelic, soft and playful loving.\n\nYou can begin to \u201cmake love\u201d on the heart chakra by imagining a white energy ball or stream rising up from the perineum through the spine and onto the chakra of your choice. Ask your partner to visualize the same. You can play around with this technique while tuning into other chakras.\n\nYou may want to massage their solar chakra (or navel chakra that can be associated with fire and is located just above the navel. When activated, the solar chakra can incite hot, intense and passionate play.\n\nAt the end of the massage, be receptive to the sensations your partner felt during the session. It is important to keep in mind when it comes to Tantric-massage remember that all sensations are welcome.\n\nYou should encourage your partner to talk to share if they felt new sensations if something didn\u2019t feel right if something felt weird/hurt etc. Practice conscious listening, and be receptive to what worked well for your partner and what didn\u2019t.\n\nUltimately the less you say (as the giver) to make room for your partner (the receiver) the more room you both have as lovers to make the best Tantric-massage even more sensual.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a Guru to do it!\n\nThese basic Tantra techniques will get you started on the right track to tantra-lizing your partner into spiritual (even erotic) ecstasy!<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Tantric Masturbation: 10 Steps to Fly Solo Mindfully\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Tantra. Though its origins are scholarly and religious, many people \u2013 including us! \u2013 associate Tantra with sex in the modern day. Tantric sex is all about awareness; focusing on present sensations free of judgment allows us to become more in tune with ourselves and our partners. The roots of this practice are spiritual in nature and stretch back millennia.\n\nFortunately, it doesn\u2019t take that long to master.\n\nErotic Tantric practices can be explored with or without a partner. That\u2019s right \u2013 Tantric masturbation is a thing! And it\u2019s awesome.\nTantric masturbation is all about self-pleasure and self-care. Just like with Tantric sex, the goal of Tantric self-love is to consciously enjoy the process. It is similar to meditation, another solo activity; both involve mindfulness and getting to know oneself on a deeper level. It can even lead to a spiritual awakening.\n\nI definitely wasn\u2019t convinced at first, but even skeptics like me can benefit from the tenants of this immersive practice. It might come off as magic or fake science, but even if you don\u2019t subscribe to spirituality the benefits are 100% real.\n\nTrust me. Now I can\u2019t wait to have some time to myself.\n\nTantric self-love can be explored by anyone \u2013 expert, skeptic, and all in between. At its core, Tantric masturbation is about trying to get more in touch (pun intended) with yourself and your sexuality.\n\nYou don\u2019t actually need much to start your Tantric masturbation practice and because everyone is different, what you do need might vary. However, here are some tips to help get anyone started:\n\nThe most important thing is to relax. If your head is full of worries or you feel super awkward, it\u2019s going to be tough focusing on the present moment. Don\u2019t just get comfortable though \u2013 indulge yourself! Lie on plush pillows, light some candles, play sexy music \u2013 whatever helps. This is a new experience, so go ahead and treat yourself like you would a lover.\n\nTantric self-love is very much about exploration and should not be rushed. The energy created from masturbation can be harnessed based on your own pace, so take your time. In fact, if you are interested in the spiritual aspect of the practice and not just the good feels, a major component of Tantra is harnessing one\u2019s energy to aid in spiritual growth. That\u2019s right, this stuff is enlightening.\n\nTantric self-love is related to self-discovery, so it works differently for everyone based on one\u2019s personal desires and needs. Also, Tantra isn\u2019t necessarily about achieving orgasm. In fact, the longer you can last without coming, the more energy will be built up. So, don\u2019t worry about achieving anything in particular, especially the first time. Just let it happen.\n\nNow that you have everything you need, it\u2019s time for the fun part! Let\u2019s get right down to it.\n\nSet your goal(s) beforehand, or at least consider what they might be. Are you trying to find new erogenous zones? Feel less awkward about masturbating? Change things up? De-stress? Become the next yogi master? Tantric self-love is a great way to accomplish all of these and more. Just remember: though it helps to have a purpose in mind, there\u2019s no pressure to actually get there.\n\nPracticing Tantra alone might seem awkward, but it is actually a great place to start. Do whatever normally makes you feel comfortable during a masturbation sesh to begin\u2026 and then take it a bit further.\n\nLie on your back, elevate your head, and put pillows under your back and legs.\n\nMaybe even start with some yoga and meditation or a warm bath. Do you! (Literally.)\n\nHere comes the mindfulness bit. After you get comfortable, come to stillness and become aware of your breathing and how your body is feeling. Close your eyes. Put one hand on your heart. Then start when you\u2019re ready.\n\nYou can still fantasize, but also be mindful of how you are feeling and reacting. If you normally resort to external stimulants to get aroused, like porn, it\u2019s best not to use those during your Tantric practice. Focus internally and on the here and now.\n\nGo to town! There aren\u2019t many rules here. It\u2019s best to use your hands since it enhances the full-body sensory experience. However, if you need or prefer to use toys, go ahead! None of us get aroused in the same way.\n\nSometimes we all crave a tasty quickie, but Tantric masturbation \u2013 to explore an old cliche \u2013 is more about the journey than the destination. Feel free to take your time making your way to your penis or clitoris or wherever it is that usually gets you going.\n\nFocus on your erogenous zones.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know where those are, touch yourself in places you normally wouldn\u2019t. You might even find out something new about yourself!\n\nRemember there is no rush or specific end goal you have to achieve. \u00a0Orgasms are the icing on the cake \u2013 if not gift that keeps on giving \u2013 but it\u2019s more than possible to enjoy the ride without \u201cmaking it to the finish line.\u201d Self-love comes in many forms and it\u2019s important to remember we all experience pleasure differently. Just enjoy yourself. I can\u2019t say this enough!\n\nMake the bed creak, moan, dirty talk to yourself \u2013 anything goes! Masturbate like no one is watching! Unless, of course, that\u2019s your thing.\n\nNow is not the time to get distracted by what\u2019s for dinner or that annoying meeting you have to attend tomorrow. Take control of your sensations, not the other way around. When you find something that feels good, take note of it.\n\nThough orgasm isn\u2019t necessarily the goal of Tantric masturbation, it\u2019s capital-O-Obvious that this might happen as a result of an extended exploration of the self. Those with extensive experience in the art of enthusiastically pleasuring themselves might even reach something called Kundalini orgasm.\n\nKundalini is a term from ancient India that describes a life force each person possesses. This force tends to lay dormant but eventually becomes awakened. Its potential is usually unlocked through a devoted meditation practice, yet it can also come about from Tantric sex and masturbation (or even spontaneously!).\n\nTo achieve a kundalini orgasm you have to feel very relaxed and in control. Harnessing this energy is an important part of Tantra. It allows this force, which lies coiled at the base of one\u2019s spine, to unravel and awaken. You probably won\u2019t get there the time, but don\u2019t worry. What orgasm doesn\u2019t already feel like a glorious unraveling?\n\nDon\u2019t feel pressure to come, however;\n\nThe point is to enjoy yourself, whatever that means to you.\n\nYou can stop whenever you feel satisfied.\u00a0If you conform to a specific gender or have just one set of genitalia, you might be wondering if there are specific tips to spice up your juicy self-love session. Lucky you, the answer is yes yes YES!\n\nPro-tips for men/people with penises:\n\nPro-tips for women/people with vaginas:\n\nOnce you\u2019ve reached the point of peak satisfaction it\u2019s important not to rush off right away! Remember to take time out for this practice so afterward so you can spend a few more moments alone with yourself. Revel in the new and delicious sensations you\u2019ve just discovered.\n\nJust as you would following a yoga or meditation practice, lie in Savasana (a completely still and relaxed pose) and return your breathing to normal. Rest one hand on your Yoni or Lingam and the other on your heart. Visualize the energy you created returning to the universe. Integrate what you learned from the experience into how you live your daily life. The practice should be fun, but it also has the potential to be utterly transformative.\n\nThat\u2019s it! It may sound like a lot (okay it is).\n\nIf you take anything away from this article, view this information as guidelines rather than a strict set of rules you have to follow. As I mentioned, the main goal is to enjoy yourself, so take what you need from here to do just that. I know I did.<|endoftext|>"}

We hear rumors that sex can last for days, orgasms for hours.\n\nI looked to real tantric masters and stories from beginners to find out what really happens during tantric sex, how to achieve a tantric orgasm even if you are completely new to the game.\n\nTantra is a spiritual practice combining energy and consciousness as one. Think of your energy as your body and what it feels, and your consciousness as your mind and thoughts.\n\nTantra looks at these things as deeply connected, not separate. The marriage between energy and consciousness goes beyond just mind-blowing sex, but Tantra is widely practiced to experience sexual ecstasy.\n\nTantra describes ecstasy as when you experience pleasure in both your body and your mind at the same time.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just a physical feeling, it is when your body and mind are engaged in an intense state of pleasure.\n\nThe history of Tantra and its connection to amazing sexual pleasure can all be found in the book Urban Tantra by Barbara Carrellas (Amazon).\n\nNow for the good stuff!\n\nA tantric orgasm is pure ecstasy.\n\nIt is achieved by tapping into the present in your mind and body through a combination of exercises, guided breathing, and meditation.\n\nShashi Solluna is a Tantra writer and teacher. She writes about a tantric orgasm she experienced at an event with other Tantra followers.\n\nShe describes being caressed by many individuals at once, but in non-sexual way.\u00a0Like \u201cbeing stroked like a cat.\u201d\n\nShe felt a huge energy surge, and experienced so much pleasure it felt almost too intense.\n\nShe felt as though she was \u201cbetween crying and laughing.\u201d\n\nShashi paints a picture of the non-sexual nature of Tantra. While its teachings can lead to sexual bliss, it\u2019s a deeper and more wide-spread orgasm than ones from stimulation or thoughts alone.\n\nThe orgasm is not far off from the orgasms most of us have already had. The energy felt during the experience pulls through your body to your mind. Most describe it as feeling very free.\n\nAn intense but peaceful experience.\n\nYou can dive in the deep end and buy books, attend healing events, and connect with other Tantra lovers in your local community. But, you can also experience the intense pleasure and ecstasy Tantra has to offer if you just wade in the shallow end and try a few exercises.\n\nThere are many fun exercises you can do from home. You can practice Tantra alone, or with partners, or even with similar-minded friends (remember, it doesn\u2019t have to be sexual!).\n\nTantra has specific tantric breaths that can be practiced, but you don\u2019t need to be a tantric breath expert to try it. Try setting aside five minutes to breathe without any distraction.\n\nNote how you feel before, during and after the exercise.\n\nCongrats! You\u2019ve just practiced Tantra.\n\nTake this exercise even further by introducing your partner.  Tantra teacher Sofia Sundari has a great video on how to practice conscious breathing together.\n\nStart with synchronized breathing for a few counts, and then increase your intensity to breathing deeply from your belly together. Try this for at least ten minutes and talk with your partner after about what you experienced and how you felt after.\n\nTo practice Tantra through touch, think about and try finding the sweet spot of touch that makes you feel something intensely but is not sexual. A perfect example is a hug from someone you care about.\n\nThere is both a feeling of love and connection (mind) and a pleasing physical sensation (body).\n\nThis is also a great excuse to go to a spa and get a massage \u2013 another way to experience tantric touch. Even petting your beloved animals can give you these tantric feelings.\n\nA simple exercise of rocking back and forth can bring about great tantric energy. An ideal position for tantric movement is to lay down with your knees up and feet on the ground, but really any position will work.\n\nOnce in position, rock your pelvis (the space between your hip bones) up and down. Find a natural groove and rhythm. Don\u2019t worry about if you\u2019re doing it right, or if you should speed up or slow down \u2013 just let your body flow.\n\nThis tantric exercise will get your energy moving. It wakes up your senses, but also your emotions. It helps the physical energy move through your body into your mind. Note how you feel before, during and after.\n\nA huge pillar of Tantra is letting go. Of everything. Of time and expectations.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that having a tantric orgasm sounds like an amazing time, but practicing Tantra is about the journey, not the destination.\n\nYou might be motivated to get down to business and practice Tantra day and night to feel the amazing ecstasy it has to offer, but there\u2019s no harm in simply appreciating every breath and exercise as much as the orgasm.\n\nOne thing that helps me be in the present is to do a quick body scan of all the pleasure I\u2019m feeling. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in thinking about how much more pleasure we could feel, when often times there\u2019s pleasure already residing in our bodies and minds. I like to start my body scan with noticing the feeling in my toes and working my way up to my head and my thoughts.\n\nAny feeling of pleasure or ecstasy is enjoyable and something to be cherished.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you have earth-shattering, hours-long orgasms, or if you simply had a good five minutes of guided breathing. This process of letting go will only bring more Tantric pleasure into your life.\n\nTantric orgasms have been described as the ultimate feeling of freedom and pleasure in both your body and mind. Waves of energy flowing through every part of your being. Everyone deserves to feel freedom and intense pleasure, and everyone can benefit from practicing Tantra.\n\nOur current cultures teach us that sex happens in the body. To embrace Tantra is to embrace something bigger and more profound: where\u00a0sex happens when our\u00a0bodies and minds align.\n\nTantra connects us to our own selves, our partners, and our spirituality.\n\nIt opens up new doors to pleasure on top of the ones you already know. Tantra will bring you deeper into what feels good, and in the process you\u2019ll learn a whole lot about yourself and what you like.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>5 Taoist Sex Practices for Your Manliness\n\n\n\nCould the ancient Chinese philosophy of Taoism and Taoist sex be the key to revitalizing your sex life?\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of it, Taoism (or Daoism) is a more than 2500-year-old philosophy that teaches, in essence, how to follow the natural path of the universe \u2014 how to find balance, not through a higher power, but from the way we live our lives with addition of some ancient sex practices.\n\nTo define it any further would be\u2026 not very Taoist! It means something different to everyone who practices. One of the key elements of Taoism is how energy flows through the universe; in particular, for our purposes anyway, sexual energy.\n\nTaoists believe sex can create new energy and nourish your soul!\n\nJust probably not in the way you\u2019re used to doing it. Here are 5 Tao sex practices men can borrow freely, no matter what religion they are, to get more in touch with their own sexual energy.\n\nThis seems super basic, but stay with me. Practicing coordinating your breath with your body\u2019s movements will help teach you to be more mindful, present, and *ahem*\u2026 in control.\n\nSlowing down, focusing, and breathing steadily are great ways to last longer and have stronger orgasms. Modern experts agree on this. It may surprise you, but most of us are pretty bad at breathing on our own, taking only shallow breaths and accidentally holding our breath when we\u2019re tense or excited.\n\nTaoism offers plenty of great ways to learn this Taoist sex practice. For starters, practice taking long, deep, controlled inhales and exhales as you focus on relaxing every last muscle in your body.\n\nRemember how having sex can create positive energy that flows into you and, therefore, the universe? Sounds pretty good, right?\n\nGuess what\u2026 Taoists believe that when the woman, or your partner, is turned on and properly satisfied, even more of this life essence, called \u201cjing,\u201d is created. Finding out what he or she likes and doing it well won\u2019t just make your partner happier;\n\nIt\u2019ll help you feel more fulfilled and at peace with your place in the world.\n\nPretty cool, right? Now get to work!\n\nIn old-school Taoist lovemaking, ejaculation was seen as a drain on your essential life energy, though some say that point has since been over-exaggerated. But since sexual union itself is so important in Taoism, what you can take from it is;\n\nLearning to embrace the journey rather than racing to the finish.\n\nTaoist sex can teach modern men a lot about controlling their orgasms. The philosophy is particularly big on withdrawing frequently during sex, practicing breath control, and using perineal massages to delay ejaculation or avoid it completely. Many Taoists believe very short sexual unions are bad for the energy and harmony between the couple.\n\nYou may not believe in all the energy stuff, but with practice, you can totally learn to keep yourself on the brink of coming for long, mind-blowing and even multiple orgasms. The two biggest things you can start right now are practicing slowing your breathing during sex for a more relaxed body and better control, along with strengthening your pelvic floor muscles with daily kegel exercises.\n\nIf ejaculating during sex was a drain on life energy, then to old-school Taoists, masturbation was a gigantic waste. In other words, self-love was a bit of a no-no.\n\nBut today we understand that developing a healthy sexual relationship with yourself is important, and modern Taoist sex don\u2019t forbid masturbation at all.\n\nWhat you can do is take a hard look at your masturbation habits\u2026 Are you doing it too much? Watching too much porn? Using too tight of a grip?\n\nIn other words, is the way you\u2019re masturbating draining you of energy or helping you feel more at peace with yourself? Start by noticing how you feel after you masturbate. If you feel guilty, drained, or full of shame \u2014 or if it\u2019s keeping you from pursuing sex with other real live humans \u2014 your self-love habits could use some adjusting.\n\nDid ancient Taoists even lift, bro?\n\nWho knows, but many practicing Taoists today are big fans of having strong, well-developed glute muscles (your butt!). There are tons of great benefits to working your booty, from improved overall strength and athleticism, endurance, and often better control of your orgasm during sex.<|endoftext|>"}

There\u2019s ample info out there about lingam massage and how to pleasure penises, but let\u2019s not forget the balls, friends!\n\nTao masters consider massaging the scrotum to be one of the most important steps for men looking to transform their sexual energy.\n\nTesticle massage offers other health benefits too, including improved circulation, increased sperm count, higher sex drive, better orgasms, and more.\n\nYou might feel a bit nervous about attempting to give your partner a scrotum massage, as balls can be mysterious things for us nutsack non-havers. Some guys love having their testicles touched, while others might feel neutral or even nervous about the sensation.\n\nNot to worry! In this article, we\u2019ll provide some great tips and techniques for performing an amazing testicle massage.\n\nWarm up the entire scrotum to loosen the skin and increase blood flow to the area.\n\nSoak your cloth or towel in warm water and wrap it around your partner\u2019s balls for around 5 minutes. Alternatively, you could have him sit in a sauna or take a relaxing hot bath.\n\nHave your man lie down on a mat or towel and begin to relax.\n\nStart by rubbing a generous amount of the oil or lube of your choice over the entire surface of the scrotum, including the taint.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about getting messy here! Your partner can enjoy washing his nutsack after the massage for a squeaky-clean wrap-up.\n\nDon\u2019t go all in just yet.\n\nTantalize your partner a bit by massaging his taint, inner thighs, hip bones, and even his cock.\n\nOnce this area is awakened, he\u2019ll be able to focus his full attention on relaxing and receiving pleasure during the massage.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to be able to massage both of the testicles individually, so make sure to create some space around them.\n\nTo do this, use your thumb and two fingers to massage between your partner\u2019s balls with an extremely gentle pumping motion.

Try one or all of these on for size:\n\nBy understanding what feels best to your partner and his unique nutsack, you\u2019ll be able to provide him with the best experience while massaging his sensitive man bits.\n\nFeedback is your friend here.\n\nCheck in with your partner often during the massage by asking him if what you\u2019re doing feels good, whether he\u2019d like you to apply more or less pressure, and so on.\n\nSome people can feel shy, or even afraid, when it comes to expressing how they do or don\u2019t like to be touched.\n\nYou can encourage open communication in your relationship by responding positively when your partner speaks up.\n\nConsider thanking him when he gives you feedback during the massage.\n\nPractice makes perfect, and the benefits of scrotal massage are strongest when it\u2019s performed regularly, so make it a ritual if your man is keen.\n\nIt can become a type of foreplay or a pre-sleep tradition in your bedroom.\n\nAsk your man to return the favor with an amazing yoni massage for you if that seems like something you might like.\n\nAll that\u2019s left to do now is give testicle massage a try! May your man\u2019s balls melt with pleasure in the palms of your hands.\n\n(For the purpose of aiding readability, the author has chosen to use gender-specific nouns and pronouns in this article.

But, we\u2019ve heard it\u2019s becoming famous for a different reason. Sex. But not just any sex, a crazy mix of balancing and teamwork. Yep, the Eiffel tower sex position is becoming one of the best-known threesome positions.\n\nWhat is it? Well, you need 3 people (male, female, both or in between), some pillows and a lot of energy. Here\u2019s the classic Eiffel Tower position:\n\nAs a bonus, we will also show you what happens when you throw in an extra body and make it a 69-er affair. Let\u2019s get dirty.\n\nFor discussion purposes, we will talk about the position as being done by two guys (the tower) and one girl (the\u2026 foundation?), however, the position can be done by anyone.\n\nWhen you are picking your partner (s) for your visit to the Eiffel Tower, you should keep one factor at the top of your list \u2013 being comfortable.\n\nMaking sure you are comfortable with whoever you have your threesome with will also mean you will have a certain level of trust during the experience. And what\u2019s even better? If you are comfortable and trust the people you are going to be sharing this with \u2013 there\u2019s a better chance you will be able to explore each other\u2019s curiosity and open up some new interests and positions!\n\nIf you are doing it with your partner \u2013 make sure to be super comfortable with each other and know what you are getting into before trying it out. Threesomes sometimes aren\u2019t for every couple. Some partners can get jealous, so if you think this may be an issue, the Eiffel Tower and perhaps threesomes all together might not be for you!\n\nAs there are three of you, making sure everyone is comfortable is super important. The first 30 or minutes or so of your Eiffel Tower experience should be all about creating trust between you all.\n\nTry a bit of gentle foreplay, get naked and have some fun.\n\nYou should also use this time to figure out who will be building what \u2013 mainly, who is going to be the foundation piece of the tower (if you are three gents, it\u2019s a lot easier to iron this out at the start), and who are going to be the pillars!\n\nNext, get comfortable. Whoever is going to take on the \u2018foundation\u2019 role should be comfortable with whatever they need, such as pillows underneath their knees for when things really kick off.\n\nEveryone comfy? Let\u2019s heat things up.\n\nSo, the two of you who have decided to be pillars\u2026. Stand up and face each other with the \u2018foundation\u2019 kneeling on all fours. The two pillars should spread their legs and can link one hand each in the air now, or later\u2026 whatever you are most comfortable with.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to lay the foundation!\n\nWhoever has taken on the all-fours position, should start to give head to the person in from of them, while the lover behind slowly starts to give anal (or vaginal) at the same time.\n\nTake your time \u2013 there\u2019s no rush and remember, everybody needs to be comfortable with the pace you are all going at.\n\nThe next step is to\u2026 enjoy the ride! The Eiffel Tower is one of the best and most comfortable threesome positions, let\u2019s call it the introduction to threesomes.\n\nWhy? Because you don\u2019t need to do anything too crazy, but some of the pleasures you will get out of it are anything from g-spot stimulation and deep penetration.\n\nNow, the real question is\u2026 should you keep going until somebody comes?\n\nThe answer is\u2026 it\u2019s really up to all three of you.\nIf one of you gets over the line that\u2019s great, but if all three of you get there that\u2019s even better.\n\nIt seems as though the threesome community has been busy adding even more sauce to the Eiffel Tower position and has come up with a quirkier way to enjoy it \u2013 by adding a 69 to the mix.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a foursome and not a threesome, this position is definitely a fun one to try that will make sure everyone\u2019s pleasure dials are turned riiiight up.\n\nSo, how do you do it? Easy.\n\nRemember in the above threesome where there was someone who was the \u2018foundation\u2019 of the sex tower? Well, all you need to do is put your fourth person underneath them in a 69-position, and then both of the foundation blocks will be getting anal (or vaginal) at the same time.\n\nNow, don\u2019t let the quick addition of a fourth person fool you. Making this a foursome isn\u2019t as practical as the 3-piece tower and you will all need to be quite flexible.\n\nIt isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted, but if you manage to nail it\u2026 it can add even more fun by letting everyone switch up positions so everyone can get to know the tower!\n\nOkay, the above can\u2019t be done without some flexibility and stamina\u2026 but if anyone feels pain at any time \u2013 stop, you are doing it wrong.\n\nNo matter if you are trying the classic Eiffel Tower sex position or throwing in the 69 for some fun, the positions shouldn\u2019t hurt anybody involved.\n\nHowever, if it does happen to be somebody\u2019s first time doing anal, it might take a bit for them to get into, so we don\u2019t recommend the Eiffel Tower being your first soiree into trying the back passage. Instead, try the tower vaginally, or if you want to get even kinkier, you could even add a sex toy in here!\n\nRemember, you should all be able to have great sex doing this position \u2013 with a bit of effort, it can turn into an amazing sexual experience for everyone.\n\nThe key to really enjoying the Eiffel tower sex position is being comfortable with your partners and choosing them carefully. Once you\u2019ve picked out the two (or three) people you are going to share this crazy ride with, remember to have fun and to not take the whole thing too seriously!\n\nHave a laugh, get comfortable and give it some time to pay off (it will trust us). Bon Voyage!<|endoftext|>"}

Many people navigate through a relationship with emotional trauma and confusion, never really grasping the reason when, why and how things went so terribly wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a short quote by Osho:\n\n\u201cYou are born with the capacity to love, but you are not born with the art of love. The art of love has to be taught, has to be imbibed.\u201d\n\nIt is divine and at the same time elementary.\n\nWe Believe the Art of Love is Knowledge Everyone Deserves\n\nSo let\u2019s imbibe it!\n\nHere at , we come across various sexuality experts and Tantra teachers who have numerous things to say on how to create a successful and loving relationship.\n\nThe lack of good sexual education or you could say the lack of tools and equipment to experience the relationship we envision is one of the main reason why couples end up separating, feeling frustrated and even cheat on each other.\n\nSo when we talk to experts all around the world, they share with us techniques on how to improve our sex life, how to move during sex, how to breathe during sex, how to give and receive unconditionally, what positions and massage techniques work best and what you need to visualize\u2026 all in the name to better our sexual experience, feel more fulfilled and heal a lover\u2019s, heart.\n\nIt can be quite overwhelming for the beginner to implement Tantra practices without feeling slightly absurd.\n\nWell, let us share with you\u2026\n\nWe believe this knowledge is so powerful that it feels like Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s paintbrush felt into your lap, ready to assist you in drawing an unforgettable fulfilling romantic night.\n\nWhen Sarita shared this knowledge with us, it suddenly all made sense.\n\nIt assumes that men and women are opposite and yet complementary in their sexual and relationship needs.\n\nPicture a spiral with the center of the spiral being the sex center. Sarita\u2019s theory says that a man\u2019s energy is naturally focused very strongly on the sex center.\n\nThis is what Sarita explains:\n\n\u201cSimilar to the way ripples form, when you throw a stone into the lake, moving from the center to the circumference, so it is with male sexual activation.\n\nBegin sexual activity with a man by honoring his lingam [penis] first and foremost.\n\nOnce he is aroused and feels his potency rising, you can then spread this awakened sexual power all over his body by stroking down his legs to his feet and up through his torso to the shoulders and down his arms and out of his hands.\n\nThis will help him to feel recognized and understood in regards to his nature and will also help him to expand his capacity for whole body pleasure states.\u201d\n\nTakeaway:\n\nStart to arouse his lingam first, that\u2019s where he will feel most seen, most honored and loved. Only then link his aroused pleasure to other areas of his body.\n\nImagine another spiral with the center of the spiral being her sexual center. Begin sexual activity with a woman by focusing on the circumference of her body.\n\nSarita shares:\n\n\u201cFor a woman, it is important to very slowly and progressively move towards her sex center. Start the approach be teasing and inviting rather than going directly to the Yoni.\n\nThe same way you would approach the inner sanctum of a temple is the way to approach a woman sexually. As we move into the courtyard of a temple, we simultaneously enter into awe, lingering in front of a beautiful statue to pray, or stopping to admire the stained glass windows before finally entering into space where we will encounter the holy of holies.\n\nA woman\u2019s Yoni is a place for reverence and awe. If a man can approach his woman in this way, her ecstasy and surrender with him will know no limits.\u201d\n\nTakeaway:\n\nTouch her shoulders or knees to create an ambiance of trust. Kiss her. Hold her lower belly with full presence to open her up into emotional fluidity.\n\nThe foreplay is THE crucial element for a woman to awaken her sexual energies. Sarita actually calls it erotic play instead of foreplay, as she believes it\u2019s is not a preliminary for the \u2018real thing\u2019 \u2013 it is the real thing! Activate her breasts to open her heart center.\n\nThen and only then, when she is long and lovingly adored approach her Yoni (vagina).\n\nVery often one of the partners believes that their partner has to behave just like them.

Many people navigate through a relationship with emotional trauma and confusion, never really grasping the reason when, why and how things went so terribly wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a short quote by Osho:\n\n\u201cYou are born with the capacity to love, but you are not born with the art of love. The art of love has to be taught, has to be imbibed.\u201d\n\nIt is divine and at the same time elementary.\n\nWe Believe the Art of Love is Knowledge Everyone Deserves\n\nSo let\u2019s imbibe it!\n\nHere at , we come across various sexuality experts and Tantra teachers who have numerous things to say on how to create a successful and loving relationship.\n\nThe lack of good sexual education or you could say the lack of tools and equipment to experience the relationship we envision is one of the main reason why couples end up separating, feeling frustrated and even cheat on each other.\n\nSo when we talk to experts all around the world, they share with us techniques on how to improve our sex life, how to move during sex, how to breathe during sex, how to give and receive unconditionally, what positions and massage techniques work best and what you need to visualize\u2026 all in the name to better our sexual experience, feel more fulfilled and heal a lover\u2019s, heart.\n\nIt can be quite overwhelming for the beginner to implement Tantra practices without feeling slightly absurd.\n\nWell, let us share with you\u2026\n\nWe believe this knowledge is so powerful that it feels like Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s paintbrush felt into your lap, ready to assist you in drawing an unforgettable fulfilling romantic night.\n\nWhen Sarita shared this knowledge with us, it suddenly all made sense.\n\nIt assumes that men and women are opposite and yet complementary in their sexual and relationship needs.\n\nPicture a spiral with the center of the spiral being the sex center. Sarita\u2019s theory says that a man\u2019s energy is naturally focused very strongly on the sex center.\n\nThis is what Sarita explains:\n\n\u201cSimilar to the way ripples form, when you throw a stone into the lake, moving from the center to the circumference, so it is with male sexual activation.\n\nBegin sexual activity with a man by honoring his lingam [penis] first and foremost.\n\nOnce he is aroused and feels his potency rising, you can then spread this awakened sexual power all over his body by stroking down his legs to his feet and up through his torso to the shoulders and down his arms and out of his hands.\n\nThis will help him to feel recognized and understood in regards to his nature and will also help him to expand his capacity for whole body pleasure states.\u201d\n\nTakeaway:\n\nStart to arouse his lingam first, that\u2019s where he will feel most seen, most honored and loved. Only then link his aroused pleasure to other areas of his body.\n\nImagine another spiral with the center of the spiral being her sexual center. Begin sexual activity with a woman by focusing on the circumference of her body.\n\nSarita shares:\n\n\u201cFor a woman, it is important to very slowly and progressively move towards her sex center. Start the approach be teasing and inviting rather than going directly to the Yoni.\n\nThe same way you would approach the inner sanctum of a temple is the way to approach a woman sexually. As we move into the courtyard of a temple, we simultaneously enter into awe, lingering in front of a beautiful statue to pray, or stopping to admire the stained glass windows before finally entering into space where we will encounter the holy of holies.\n\nA woman\u2019s Yoni is a place for reverence and awe. If a man can approach his woman in this way, her ecstasy and surrender with him will know no limits.\u201d\n\nTakeaway:\n\nTouch her shoulders or knees to create an ambiance of trust. Kiss her. Hold her lower belly with full presence to open her up into emotional fluidity.\n\nThe foreplay is THE crucial element for a woman to awaken her sexual energies. Sarita actually calls it erotic play instead of foreplay, as she believes it\u2019s is not a preliminary for the \u2018real thing\u2019 \u2013 it is the real thing! Activate her breasts to open her heart center.\n\nThen and only then, when she is long and lovingly adored approach her Yoni (vagina).\n\nVery often one of the partners believes that their partner has to behave just like them. Therefore, they give what they would like, i.e. quick and direct stimulation of the female genitals combined with a sudden entry to penetrative sex.\n\nIt could also be that one partner expects the other to be open emotionally immediately, ignoring the sexual center completely. Both ways end in frustration and agony for your partner.\n\nOnce we understand the anatomy of arousal and our differences we are able to create art together\n\nIf a man\u2019s lover is willing to worship his lingam in adoration and full respect, he will then easily and naturally open his heart.\n\nIf a woman\u2019s lover is willing to honor, love and worship her as a Goddess throughout her entire body before connecting with her genital area, she will yearn to open her legs for her lover.<|endoftext|>"}

{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>The Best Thrusting Sex Toys For Hands-Free Fun\n\n\n\nThrusting sex toys can add a whole new dimension to your sexual pleasure.\n\nGoing by their name, thrusting sex toys might make even the most adventurous of us raise an eyebrow or two. Does that mean my vagina is just going to get jack-hammered into\u2026? Sounds painful. Au Contraire, my pleasure seeking friend!\n\nThrusting sex toys are an exhilerating way for you to focus on vaginal or anal stimulation with little effort on your part. Great for the lazy hedonists out there. Plus, many of them have added clit stimulators which are great for blended orgasms. Think of them as dildos and vibrators with a little extra sass!\n\nWhether it\u2019s at home by yourself, or guiding a partner on how to better please you, a thrusting sex toy might just be your new favourite accessory.\n\nA thrusting sex toy is a phallic-shaped toy designed to provide penetrative sex, mimicking the sensations of a thrusting penis. Luckily for you, they come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, and they\u2019re also sold as vibrators\u00a0and\u00a0dildos. The choice means there\u2019s more than one way you can reach mind-blowing orgasms!\n\nSo what is the difference between a thrusting vibrator and a thrusting dildo?\n\nA thrusting vibrator has an in-built motor in its shaft that extends and retracts in a way that other vibes don\u2019t. Some thrusting toys move like an accordion (up and down!), while others have a motor that rotates the head of the vibrator. If that\u2019s not enough excitement, many thrusting vibrators have a bonus clitoral stimulator like a rabbit or suction device.\n\nThese kinky functions are controlled separately from the thrusting motion of the vibrator, so you can totally mix up your pleasure depending on your mood!\n\nThrusting dildos don\u2019t have a vibrating shaft or clit stimulator, which makes them the ultimate pick for anyone wanting a simple hands-free thrusting experience. Plus, if you\u2019re looking for a toy that can be used both vaginally and anally, a thrusting dildo may be more up your alley\n\nThe best way of choosing a toy is to think about what kind of fantasy you\u2019re looking to conquer.\n\nIf you tend to like it when your partner focuses on clitoral stimulation, a thrusting rabbit may be able to take your next orgasm to the next level with its in-built clit stimulator. Or, if you\u2019re looking for a toy that can be used in vaginal and anal penetration, thrusting dildos could be the perfect option for you to spice up play-time. Just make sure to clean it in-between orifices.\n\nSpeaking of cleaning. Whenever you buy a new toy, it\u2019s always important to clean it first (and before and after every use). The best way to do this is by simply washing them with warm water and mild soap and wiping them clean with a damp cloth.\n\nNext: lube. For easier penetration, lubricate the head of your toy with a water-based personal lubricant, while making sure to work the lubricant a couple of inches below the shaft. If silicone-based lube is your thing, be mindful that it can damage silicone sex toys \u2013 so best stick to water-based.\n\nOnce your toy is all lubed up, carefully insert the toy inside your vagina or anus, and if you\u2019re using a toy with a clitoral stimulator, put it over the clitoris or the perineum. If you want to start gently, turn on the stimulator on a low setting as it rests over the clitoral hood. When you\u2019re ready to ramp things up, try spreading your labia and revving up the simulator, pressing firmly against the clitoris to get the sparks flying.\n\nNow here comes the fun part: activate the thrusting motor.\n\nYou can adjust how deep inside you want to hold the shaft to enjoy the sensual movement of the toy and position it in the right place. It\u2019s totally up to you what you prefer\u2014some people love shallow movements that tantalise the delicate nerve endings\u00a0just inside the vagina. Others? Well, they love a deeply penetrating experience. It\u2019s totally up to you!\n\nIf you\u2019re more into\u00a0butt-play, the nerve endings are nearer to the entrance. But if you\u2019re well versed in all things anal, don\u2019t be afraid to try going deep for a more intense sensation. Try both options and explore your body to see what you like best. Sometimes you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve started, you can adjust the clitoral stimulator for sensitivity if needed. Then, select a vibrating pattern or strength setting that appeals to your arousal, before you lay back, relax and enjoy the hands-free thrusting orgasms of your new sex toy.\n\nJust think of all the added sensual stimulation you now have that your hands are free to touch elsewhere\u2014while the thrusting toy takes over your pleasure.\n\nThrusting Sex Toys\n\nOur last toy on the list is a collab between two of the world\u2019s most popular sex toy shops: Lovehoney and Fun Factory.\n\nThis cheeky vibrator mimics the real thing; aiming to recreate sex through 10 thrilling thrusting modes that\u2019ll be sure to leave you in bed all day.

We all get something out of the pleasure we manage to offer our partners. But it is crucial that you understand there\u2019s only one central motivation that will make you great at oral sex.\n\nBefore all other things, you have to find pleasure in giving her pleasure.\n\nThat\u2019s right. If the physical act of giving head is not working as a massive turn on for you, then you\u2019re not doing it right. If you\u2019re just doing it to take pride in the fact that you can give her awesome orgasms, or if you do it thinking about what you\u2019re gonna get in return, it\u2019s just not going to work.\n\nIt\u2019s not about an exchange, and it\u2019s not about \u201clocking down\u201d\u00a0a partner thanks to your mind-blowing skills for pussy eating. It\u2019s doing it simply because you take physical and mental pleasure in losing yourself into the experience, and taking part in the amazing sensations that you\u2019re producing in her body.\n\nThe best way to really read the signs in a woman\u2019s body, and to know exactly what movements and what pressure she needs from your tongue at each moment, is to be so absorbed into the experience that you don\u2019t lose a single detail out of\u00a0everything that\u2019s happening.\n\nWomen love when a man knows how to lick up their pussy the right way, just as much as men love to get a good blowjob. There\u2019s one difference, though: women may not want to receive oral sex on every single occasion (while most men will welcome the idea almost any time).\n\nThe reason for this is not that women want sex less, but simply that they have a more complex relationship to it, both for physical and cultural reasons.\n\nFor one part, the nerve endings that surround the clitoris and the whole vaginal area are\u00a0much richer and also more diverse than the nerve endings from your penis. Since\u00a0she has a broader sensorial capacity, she has a number of stimulation styles she can choose from,\u00a0and of course oral doesn\u2019t have to be her first choice every time. The article on 8 types of female orgasms might help you form the better picture about it.\n\nBut for the other part, there are some women who have never felt comfortable with the general aspect of their vulva and their vagina, since our society tends to put a lot of negative judgments around female sexuality.\n\nYou have to understand what\u2019s the relation of your partner to her body in general, and her pussy in particular, so you can know how comfortable she feels about oral sex. She might need a really loving and reassuring attitude from your part, to trust that she can open with you about that part of her body that makes her feel so insecure.\n\nWhile sometimes fast & furious is the way to go for certain parts of sex, a good session of eating pussy should always start out like a delicate and progressive endeavor.\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t go for the kill right away. Seduce her whole body first, with feather-like caresses both from your hands and your lips. Show her how passionate you feel about the look, the odor and the taste of every inch of her skin.\n\nRemember that part about finding pleasure in the whole experience? Well, it\u00a0starts\u00a0right here. The more authenticly devoted to her pleasure you seem, the sexier she\u2019ll feel, the hotter she\u2019s gonna get, and the more\u00a0intense her orgasmic\u00a0response will be (when you get to that point, of course, but let\u2019s not get ahead of it!).\n\nOnly when you can see she\u2019s really turned on, start to hint that you wanna go down on her.\n\nThe more time you take to get to her pussy, once you start teasing with the idea of kissing her inner thighs, the more aware she\u2019ll be\u00a0of all the sensations that will start building up around her yoni (yoni is our word of choice to talk about pussies, by the way; it means \u201csacred gateway\u201d in the old Sanskrit language, and we use it to convey the sense of wonder and devotion that we believe every man should have when it comes to treating a woman\u2019s body).\n\nCombine the touch of your fingers and your mouth to go around the little patches of skin that almost touch the side of her outer lips, and very slowly start to caress her yoni directly. Gentle kisses, and very gentle strokes with your fingers, combined with an occasional moan or heavy breathing\u00a0can bring her to the heightened state of excitement that you\u2019re gonna need from this point on.\n\nWhile moans are a great way to let your partner know how turned on you\u2019re in your journey down to her legs, you can\u2019t rely solely on them to keep communication open at all times.\n\nA woman always appreciates honest compliments about her body. Sometimes she\u2019ll be into dirty talking, and sometimes she won\u2019t, but you can always listen to her cues and sense what are the right words to let her know\u00a0just how awesome you\u2019re feeling at each moment.\n\nBig hint: don\u2019t say anything you don\u2019t really feel, and don\u2019t force yourself to use a certain lingo or throw a line you heard in a movie. Be\u00a0true to your style and to what you\u2019re feeling, and that will be more than enough.\n\nClits are the most sensitive part of a woman\u2019s body, and while they are capable of receiving a lot of pleasure, they also have to be handled carefully.\n\nWhat you want to try is building up the stimulation, from a very subtle caress to a steady rhythm of stroking.\n\nStart with really slow movements of your tongue laid flat against her whole yoni, using big circles or long up and down movements to stimulate the whole area, and don\u2019t overcharge her clit with too many sensations from the start.\n\nOnly after you\u2019ve spent a good time with this kind of broad and light licking, you can slowly shift your attention towards the head of the clitoris, and ever so slowly increase the speed of your motion.\n\nTake in mind that some women prefer to stay at an indirect stimulation of the clit, with your tongue moving only on top of her hood, while other women appreciate that you slowly move towards uncovering the head of the clitoris, and applying direct pressure there with your tongue.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to limit yourself to the circular motion you started with. Actually, combining a bit of sucking and side to side strokes are a great way to identify what kind of stimulation works best for what her clit needs right at that moment.\n\nYou should never decide to use the same movements or techniques all the time, simply because it has worked for you in the past with\u00a0an ex, or even with your current partner!\n\nThe experience of each different woman is unique,\u00a0but the experience of the same woman is also unique in itself each new time she shares a moment of mindful sex with you.\n\nThis means you really want to make sure you pay extra attention to her response at every slight variation you make with your tongue. Spend a little time at each different kind of motion, so you have time to notice if it\u2019s bringing her the intense kind of pleasure you\u2019re aiming for, or if it\u2019s a good idea to keep on searching what\u2019s the best way to eat\u00a0your partner\u2019s pussy.\n\nAnd once you\u2019ve found the combination of a sweet spot and the right angle of your mouth, make sure you stick to it.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to keep on switching between different moments once you\u2019ve spotted the spot that\u2019s making her body arch a little and her hips come closer to your mouth. If you feel you\u2019re at the right place and position,\n\nIf you feel you\u2019re at the right place and position, all that\u2019s left is to very slowly increase the pressure and the speed of your strokes, until you reach\u00a0the right point of intensity (you can ask for her feedback if you\u2019re not sure), and stay there until the fireworks arrive.\n\nBe patient and consistent with your tongue. It may be tiring the first times you dive really deep into a good session of pussy eating, but we can guarantee you the\u00a0skills you\u2019ll get in return for the sore muscles are totally gonna be worth it.\n\nAnother way of treating her clit (and actually her whole body) the right way, is to pay a lot of attention to\u00a0the way she reacts at every point down the road.\n\nRight from the very start, if you\u2019re unsure about the message that her body is sending on receiving oral at that moment, you can try phrasing what you want to do, and see if her reaction is positive.\n\nAlways keep in mind that you wanna be subtle, so instead of saying something like \u201cI want to eat your pussy. That OK?\u201d, you can go for something more like inhaling deeply when you\u2019re near her thighs, and then saying out loud: \u201cI can\u2019t believe how good you smell. I wanna get you in my mouth so bad\u201d.\n\nIf she trembles a little,\u00a0gasps, or seems excited about the idea in any other way, you know you can go on. And if she kind of pulls away or looks too serious, then she\u2019s probably not ready for it on that particular day, but make sure to hold her close and listen to anything she wants to share with you about it.\n\nAs you move further and further into higher states of pleasure for her, the intensity of your tongue strokes is going to increase, and it\u2019s most likely that you\u2019ll be focused so much on that movement, that your hands are going to be resting at a fixed position.\n\nBut you can step up your game and use your hands to create even more waves of bliss and sensations for her. You can go for feather-like caresses all over her body, you can play with her inner and outer lips, and you can even try some inner stimulation by sliding one of your fingers inside her vagina.\n\nBe really mindful about this, and ask either with words or with your body language whether it\u2019s ok for her that you use one finger inside her (always start with one finger, and then insert a second one once it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s enjoying and that she\u2019s wet enough).\n\nOne cool way to to do this is by placing your finger at the very entrance of her vagina, and see if her yoni instinctively tries to call the finger inside each time it\u2019s contracted through breathing. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, no worries, just let her know that you\u2019d love to feel her from inside her as she approaches orgasm, and then you\u2019ll know for sure if your finger fits what she\u2019s looking for at the moment.\n\nWhile all of the tips we\u2019ve shared with you in this article can help you share a world-rocking and mindful experience with your partner, you have to work your own way to the perfect oral sex roadmap for you and your partner.\n\nAnd you need to take into account that it won\u2019t be a fixed route, but rather a collection of little insights and points of complicity that will help you create an exciting and brand-new experience each time.\n\nIt\u2019s awesome that you\u2019ve come in here looking for more resources on how to be a better lover, but it\u2019s even better if you take these ideas as a starting point, rather than making them your personal Oral Bible.\n\nRemember: there is no magical list of pussy eating tricks that will make you the most desired man by women on the planet, but\u2026 if you really make good use of our 10 tips, your partner will be extremely happy that you\u2019ve stumbled upon this page.<|endoftext|>"}

I\u2019m sure you know as well as I do, that having sex or masturbating are not always appropriate options depending on when and where you find yourself.\n\nBut, there are many other things you can try to alleviate these feelings, and not having to excuse yourself to nip off to the bathroom every hour!\n\nFeeling horny is a natural body response that we usually experience for the first time during puberty. Everyone has these sexual urges \u2013 some of us more than others \u2013 because the need to procreate is hardwired into our brains as human beings. Aside from that, sex feels so damn good! Am I right?\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal to want to keep doing something that stimulates your body and your mind.\n\nIt\u2019s the same when it comes to anything we enjoy, for example, delicious food. It doesn\u2019t matter how full you are, you\u2019re going to polish off the rest of that ice cream, even if you have to loosen your trousers a little (we\u2019ve all been there).\n\nSo, what does being horny feel like?\n\nHere are some of the common symptoms you might experience when feeling horny. You might experience just one or two of these or all of them.\n\nOne of the most common symptoms of being horny is that you can\u2019t stop thinking about sex, or you find yourself with the urge to have sex all the time or watch porn frequently.\n\nIf this persists over the years, you are probably someone who is hornier than most \u2013 and that\u2019s no bad thing. Remember, judging your body is a recipe for disaster because we are all so different.\n\nBeing horny means that your sexuality is awake, and can lead to difficulty sleeping. This is because your mind is still alert, and filled with thoughts of the person you fancy, or sexual fantasies.\n\nThis is what is often labeled as sexual frustration, and the only way to alleviate this tension is to find a way to release it.\n\nSex would be most people\u2019s go-to here, but we\u2019re trying to think outside the box here, so stick with me!\n\nYou probably don\u2019t need me to tell you what happens when girls and guys get happy.\n\nIf you often have a tingly sensation down below, it\u2019s usually a sign that you\u2019re turned on. This is because when you\u2019re sexually aroused, blood flows to your genitals, and your nipples, increasing the sensitivity in those areas.\n\nStudies have shown that when you\u2019re sexually frustrated, you can get more stressed than usual.\n\nWe all experience a certain amount of stress in our lives, but if your stress levels extend beyond the normal day to day tasks, and you\u2019re feeling more anxious, it could be because you\u2019re horny.\n\nThere are a number of different possible reasons for why you find yourself getting horny more often than other people.\n\nAnd let\u2019s just address this elephant in the room: None of them are because you\u2019re weird. Got it?\n\nHormones affect your sex drive in a big way. When women are on their period or using birth control, they experience a spike in their hormones. Being pregnant also causes a big change in your hormones, and can lead to a heightened sex drive.\n\nMore testosterone is produced during these times, which leads to an increased libido.\n\nFoods including celery, avocado, watermelon, blackberries, almonds, steak, bananas, broccoli, oatmeal, and mangoes are all considered to be aphrodisiacs.\n\nIf you consume many of these foods on a regular basis, that could be causing you to feel horny. Go ahead and check these libido foods.\n\nSo if I just mentioned ALL your favorite foods, you might wanna branch out.\n\nSubstances like alcohol and drugs lower your inhibitions and can help you to relax, which can increase horniness. Maybe it\u2019s time to question if alcohol and your sexuality are a good mixture?\n\nWe all know that guys, in particular, believe they\u2019ve got a face like Zac Efron and a body like The Rock when they\u2019re intoxicated.\n\nAt the beginning of any romantic relationship, everything is new and exciting, and the sexual energy is at its peak. This means you often feel like you want to have sex all day, all night, and it\u2019s something that most people experience with a new partner.\n\nThe question is, how do you keep this fire burning for the long haul, and stay sexually attracted to the same person? That\u2019s another topic for another day people.\n\nAlthough horniness is normal, you might be unknowingly suffering from a hypersexual disorder or sexual addiction. This causes an increase in your sexual drive and can result in intense sexual urges or fantasies.\n\nSo if you\u2019re having those kinds of thoughts frequently, it\u2019s worth visiting your doctor to see if there\u2019s anything else going on beneath the surface.\n\nLuckily, there are many things you can try to stop yourself from getting so horny, and relieve that sexual tension that is building within you. There\u2019s likely to be a mix of things you already know, and things that sound totally bonkers here.\n\nAny form of physical exercise is a great way to divert your sexual energy into something other than sex.\n\nThis helps to release any built-up tension, and leave you feeling \u2013 and looking \u2013 fab!\n\nTry cutting out the aphrodisiac foods we mentioned earlier, and also reducing the amount of alcohol, chocolate, sugar, animal products, and processed foods you\u2019re consuming.\n\nBasically, don\u2019t eat junk that you know is bad for your body. I\u2019m not gonna say it twice.\n\nBuddhism teaches that we are able to control our desires and urges by taking control of our minds, and meditation can help strengthen this discipline.\n\nTry and take ten minutes each day to sit in a peaceful spot, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. It\u2019s okay if you feel silly the first few times \u2013 we all do, and no one is watching you.\n\nI know this one sounds like a no-brainer, but having regular sex with your partner (if you have one) is a great way to regularly release any sexual energy that is building up within.\n\nSchedule nights in together, or early mornings to make sure your both getting yours!\n\nAgain, you might be thinking, \u201cduh, that\u2019s obvious!\u201d. Most people use masturbation as a quick relief, but there is another way to use this practice to your advantage.\nTry instead to focus on visually spreading that sexual energy throughout your body, instead of turning it inwards, and having an internal orgasm. This will help to give you a boost afterward, instead of feeling down.\n\nYou can also channel all your energy into other things you\u2019re passionate about and committed to. Get creative, throw yourself into something that excites you, and leaves you feeling inspired.\n\nDancing and yoga are great ways to express your sexual energy, and the physical part acts the same way that exercise does.\n\nInverted yoga positions are also great for spreading your sexual energy and creating a flow within your body.\n\nYou might have a build up of sexual energy in your body which is stuck because you\u2019ve got a lot of tension somewhere. A deep tissue massage can help to alleviate this tension.\n\nHaving your lower back and sacrum massaged can be really beneficial, although this should not be sought out as a form of erotic massage \u2013 this will only get you more turned on, which is NOT the goal here!\n\nHopefully, after reading this article, you now understand why you might be getting horny often, and you\u2019ve learned many tips on how to stop being horny in the future.\n\nThe main steps to take right now are: Change your diet if you need to, and ensure you\u2019re exercising daily.\n\nAfter that, you can start to incorporate some of the other tools suggested above, including meditation, yoga, or massage. And, don\u2019t forget to schedule regular breathtaking romp sessions with your partner!\n\nWhat you\u2019ve got to remember is that your libido can change a lot depending on a number of different factors. You\u2019ll be much better off accepting your body for how it is right now, instead of trying to suppress it, and focusing on how to manage your horniness in the future.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "beducated.com", "text": "<|endoftext|>Yoni Massage: What\u2019s in it for Men?\n\n\n\nThe fact that Yoni Massage is rather awesome isn\u2019t a secret. Especially if you\u2019re following this site, then you will know quite a bit about the tremendous effects that it can have. In fact, I can state that this website would not exist if there had not been the empowering practice of how to receive and give Tantric Yoni Massage.\n\nStill, when talking about it, it\u2019s often focused on the receiver. On the \u201cYoni owner\u201d. But it\u00a0does\u00a0a whole lot of things to the giver as well. In fact, I would say that its effects are divided pretty equally between the receiver and the giver. Especially if you are a couple who is sharing this\u00a0journey, and integrating it into your relationship.\n\nI\u2019d like to share my personal experiences, as well as what Tantra has to say on that topic. Keep in mind that I\u2019m a man, actively working with the topics surrounding masculinity. Of course, the giver can also be female or intersex, but due to my lack of experience with that physiology, I have chosen to speak from my point of view. But I\u2019m sure\u00a0everyone\u00a0can get something out of this article, if they approach it with an open mind.\n\nSo, what can men get when they give Yoni Massage?\n\nIf you think that\u2019s a lame reason, skip this section. But especially in long-term relationships, the lack of connection can be a huge issue.\n\nIf you decide\u00a0to go down the path of juicy personal growth as a couple, and actively work on your sexuality, that\u2019s rarely an issue anymore.\n\nPracticing Yoni Massage gives you a (slightly) ritualistic framework. A date that you have to schedule. Intimate quality time. And a discourse about what everyone likes and desires. Plus, with a bit of practice, you help your partner with releasing intense emotions. She might cry, you might as well. You hug, you kiss, and you are grateful for being with each other.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s pretty clear that a deepened connection isn\u2019t just some collateral woo woo side effect, but a reproducible outcome of regular Yoni Massage practice.\n\nMen who give Yoni Massages are better lovers \u2013 full stop.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you have one long-term partner, many changing partners, or a relationship setup somewhere in between. When giving Yoni Massages you will know your partner\u2019s\u00a0pleasure points by heart. You learn where the tensions are and how to release them. And that knowledge can not only be utilized by your fingers, but you can literally make love to her better.\n\nAnd that\u2019s one of the points that seem receiver-focused at first: Isn\u2019t that primarily good for her?\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest guys. Nothing boosts our confidence more than being a superior lover. And the kind of moan that a partner will respond with to your first touches, can make your day!\n\nI have to admit that there are times when I\u2019m just not able to give Yoni Massage to Mariah. Times when I\u2019m not super aligned with my purpose and vision. And I found it pretty interesting discovering the connection between a disturbing force in my masculinity, and the effects of giving Yoni Massages. So why\u2019s that?\n\nTo give\u00a0Yoni Massage requires tremendous masculine qualities. It\u2019s about holding the space, being present, being the pillar. Which pillar? The masculine pillar, around which the feminine energy dances. The one that stands still and vertical, while the feminine tries to seduce with her chaos. At least that\u2019s how Tantra likes to describe masculine and feminine. And in this case, it fits like a charm.\n\nThe man sits upright, present, and does the magic with his fingers. The woman lies down, shakes, cries, screams. The man observes and spreads his love (and orgasms).\n\nWhile it\u2019s a pretty fascinating role to play, you\u2019ll recognize that some days you\u2019re better at it than on others. So Yoni Massages are a good benchmark for where you\u2019re at in your masculinity. And probably even better: Yoni Massages train you to actively go into that masculine state.\n\nA major point of giving a Yoni Massage within a relationship is its unconditionalness. It\u2019s crucial that it\u2019s not an exchange of sexual services. It\u2019s crucial that you don\u2019t aim at ending the experience with self-satisfying penetration.\n\nWhy\u2019s that?\n\nBecause it shifts something in the receiver\u2019s mindset. She\u2019s only supposed to receive. There\u2019s nothing that she has to do in return. This has a major impact on all the empowering aspects of Yoni Massage. It gives her this goddess feeling, that women long for.\n\nSo no takeaway for the men here?\n\nWell, how well oiled is your unconditional giving engine? It\u2019s certainly worth practicing for most of us. Plus, as we know, giving is the ultimate satisfaction. Opposite to primal thoughts,\u00a0not\u00a0receiving, nor pizza, but giving turns out to be one of the most satisfying\u00a0things we can do.\n\nIf your hands are still not covered with virgin coconut oil yet, let me dive into the last\u00a0point I want to shed light on today. At the same time it\u2019s the most esoteric one.\n\nWe men tend to be, well, a little more physical than many women. Perception wise I mean. \u00a0At least\u00a0I\u00a0am the kind of guy that used to not feel anything during meditation, fasting, headstands, pranayama, or most of the things I tried.\n\nNow I am not following that up with a claim that giving Yoni Massages changed all that in a revolutionary way. I guess I\u2019m still on the dull side of perceiving \u201cenergies\u201d. But it does play its role in the potpourri of techniques that I\u2019m practicing, that add to my perception in a beneficial way.\n\nHow come?\n\nWhen doing it for a while, you\u2019ll notice without a doubt that the practice goes\u00a0deeper\u00a0than the physical body. Most obviously you (or your partner) will notice that emotional aspects play a role. Your partner might even report that she feels spaced out during and after a session. Good on ya if that\u2019s the case.\n\nSexual sensation has a very strong connection to the \u201cdeeper bodies\u201d, as the Yogis call it. It\u2019s no accident that there is a strong correlation between orgasm and spiritual ecstasy. It\u2019s no accident that we crave orgasms. And it\u2019s no coincidence that the sensations felt during orgasm are not only describable with physical reactions.\n\nSo in a good session, your receiver can have certain energetic experiences. And you can be part of them when you give Yoni Massage. If you wish, and if you develop the required perception, by focusing on it.\n\nAnd you can not only be part of the energetic experiences, you can also initiate and control them. Even if your perception isn\u2019t the sharpest one out there.\n\nTry it! As you can imagine,\u00a0there is not much in the way of bullet-proof scientific research on this aspect. But\u00a0pretty much every man who has given more than 25 Yoni Massages can confirm that there\u2019s something to it. Even if it\u2019s very subjective\u00a0and intangible. Fascinating though!\n\nI hope sharing some of my experiences, bundled with Tantric knowledge, has got you hooked on how to give Yoni Massage. The focus on pleasure certainly isn\u2019t upon us during this practice, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t have any effects. Au contraire!\n\nIt is most obviously\u00a0beneficial for the receiver. You can make a tremendous change in their lives. Especially if you dedicate some time to becoming good at it.\n\nAnd I hope I have shown you that\u00a0it is also useful for the giver. From obvious to subtle \u2013 there are results for everyone.\n\nWhat a great journey to go on with your partner(s).\n\nIf you want to learn more, sign up below to get Mariah\u2019s free ebook on Yoni Massage.<|endoftext|>"}

We will just call it a Yoni Egg here to not confuse you, as some eggs come in more than just Jade crystal. Yoni is the Sanskrit name for vagina and means \u201csacred temple\u201d.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nShortcut: If you consider buying a Yoni Egg, this is the best one out there. Hands down.\n\nUse coupon \"YONILOVE\" for $10 off!\n\nYou might also have heard that the Yoni Egg has healing potential to help you overcome your sexual traumas and blockages once and for all?\n\nOr perhaps you\u2019ve read somewhere that the Yoni Egg can make you multi-orgasmic and sexually energized?\n\nAnd that your sex life will never be the same\u00a0again\u00a0because it turns every woman into a Sex Goddess?\n\nYes, you\u2019ve heard correctly; the Yoni egg is a powerhouse of a tool, which is placed inside the core of a woman, the vagina, to heal herself, get stronger muscles and achieve a deeper and better connection with her Yoni and her sexuality.\n\nThere is actually a whole movement of women out there who use the egg for their own sexual\u00a0empowerment\u00a0but also to boost their creative powers. Many women report that the healing effects of the Yoni egg leave them experiencing buzzing moments of creativity, passion and aliveness.\n\nMost women use Jade for its suitable healing properties. It is inserted in the Yoni to practice exercises. The egg should be drilled vertically or horizontally to string it. This helps to remove the egg after the exercises.\n\nThe Yoni egg practice claims its roots in ancient China. It was known as a very powerful tool at that time and was kept secret. Only queens and their concubines knew about it. As it made women who worked with it very powerful, the Yoni egg was not meant for common people.\n\nThe Yoni egg is an awesome tool for strengthening and controlling the vaginal muscles and sexual energies. And luckily today this knowledge is available to everyone. You might have heard about some big promises and some crazy things you can do with this egg; don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve created a professional and integral resource for you to tap into this magical and profound practice.\n\nEvery woman or Yoni owner can use the egg. No matter how old you are, even if you don\u2019t have your menstruation anymore. You can also use it after pregnancy to recover, and of course even when you don\u2019t have a sexual partner. It is important to practice with the egg on a regular basis.\n\nI discovered the Yoni Egg when I was 27.\n\nI had heard about it from various sex therapists and coaches, however, I didn\u2019t fully understand what it was until\u00a0I went to a workshop in Bali. Suddenly, for the first time ever, I connected with my Yoni in a way that was\u00a0natural, kind, loving and incredibly healing.\u00a0I realized how disconnected I had been with her for all my life, basically.\n\nAfter I returned home from Bali, I started using my Yoni Egg\u00a0every day for about a month.\u00a0And after about a month\u00a0I experienced something\u00a0absolutely mind-blowing.\n\nMy partner was able to make me squirt. Something I had been wanting to experience for so long.\n\nThe weight of the Egg and the resistance created by gravity (walking around with it in) had switched on the nerve endings inside my vagina and\u00a0resensitized it with sensitivity, pleasure and life-force energy.\n\nWhen you have an IUD inserted, please be careful and make sure you use a\u00a0horizontally\u00a0drilled egg.\n\nAvoid using your egg if you have thrush or a bacterial infection.\n\nWhen you have your period, feel into your body and only use the egg when it really feels good for you. It is totally fine to pause your practice during your period.\n\nWhen you are pregnant please only use the egg with medical guidance.\n\nIn case you have an illness concerning your Yoni, please contact your doctor first.\n\nLet\u2019s talk first about the advantages of the Yoni egg, cause there\u00a0is\u00a0really a lot. And it\u2019s great to know what a powerful tool we\u2019re dealing with here.\n\nThe Yoni Egg helps to heal energetic blockages and awakens sexual energy.\n\nThe egg balances the mind, body and soul.\n\nIt enhances sensitivity.\n\nThe Yoni Egg is an awesome tool to use to work on certain conditions (e.g. helping with incontinence or cysts, balancing hormones, transitioning smoothly into menopause, just to mention a few). It obviously is the tool to heal sexual traumas, but it can also help with working on other traumas such as depression or diminishing of sexual energies.\n\nAs sexuality is a topic our society does not talk freely and lovingly about, working with a Yoni egg helps with getting in touch with your own sexuality and discovering this part of your body in much more depth.\n\nTalking about sex, a Yoni egg also opens the door to an orgasmic evolution. Did you know that there are many different ways to have an orgasm? Working with the egg helps your neural system to develop more nerves. This means you will feel more and may be able to feel\u00a0and\u00a0orgasm in your g-spot or cervix area or in other parts of your Yoni. Isn\u2019t this wonderful?\n\nMany women also use the egg for birth training. Having a powerful, trauma-free and energetically healthy vagina helps to have a safer birth with less pain.\n\nAs a Yoni-owner\u00a0you will really start appreciating this part of your body more, which will naturally lead to self-love and sexual confidence.\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents\n\nThere are many different sized Yoni eggs to choose from. It is always recommended to use a bigger size in the beginning, as you will feel it more easily and are more likely to get the hang of how to hold it with your vaginal muscles. After some time it\u2019s a good idea to work with a smaller egg.\n\nThe smaller the egg, the more skills and muscles it takes to work with. But you can always stick with the one egg your whole\u00a0life\u00a0if you want.\n\nTalking about the size brings us to the topic of the material, too. Traditionally Yoni eggs have been made out of Jade. Jade as a crystal has really good healing properties. It is a very balancing stone and adapts fast to your body\u2019s temperature. Using a crystal instead of plastic eggs or ben-wa balls includes the healing and powerful benefits of the stone itself.\n\nCrystals can help you break blockages and balance your energies. Make sure to use the right egg size and crystal, one that really feels the best for you. Trust your gut feeling. It\u2019s important to let your heart\u00a0speak\u00a0when choosing the right egg, not your mind.\n\nIf you want to go with a traditional Jade Egg you need to know that there are different qualities of Jade, graded into high, medium and low.\n\nOnly\u00a0jadeite\u00a0and nephrite jade are considered authentic jade.\n\nIf you are about to go shopping for a Yoni Egg, it\u2019s important to be able to determine if you\u2019ve found the real\u00a0thing\u00a0or a good fake one.\u00a0This article\u00a0should help you with this process.\n\nMany merchants and suppliers have the tendency to call any green or white looking stone \u201cjade\u201d (the ones listed below are not genuine nephrite or\u00a0jadeite\u00a0jade eggs):\n\nAmazonite\n\nAventurine\n\nSerpentine\n\nTalc\n\nChalcedony\n\nVesuvianite\n\nPrehnite\n\nGrossular garnet\n\nChrysoprase\n\nMalaysia Jade\n\nOpaque dolomite marble\n\nPounamu\n\nYou can buy an authentic nephrite jade egg at our partner store here:\n\nUse coupon \"YONILOVE\" for $10 off!\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents\n\nBefore you start using your egg for the first time, make sure that it\u2019s been cleaned and feels nice holding it in your hand. To clean the egg, give it a bath in hot water (no soap or detergent). Simply boil water, place your egg in a cup and pour the water slowly over it, then leave it immersed in the hot water for about 10 minutes.\n\nPlease be careful to not boil the egg. This really damages its crystalline structure.\n\nThis needs to be done once, before your first Yoni egg use. And then every time you feel the need for it. You can also use vinegar to clean your egg as you can read in the section \u201cHow to store it\u201d. Many women also cleanse the egg energetically. There are many different ways to discharge and recharge the egg.\n\nWashing it in salt water\n\nBathing it in a river or ocean\n\nUsing cleansing drops\n\nUsing other stones that can discharge the egg overnight, such as amethyst or hematite\n\nHaving a full moon ritual, by consciously placing your egg into the path of moonbeams.\n\nUsing other stones that can recharge the egg overnight such as mountain crystals.\n\nFilling it with Reiki energy.\n\nWe have also heard of digging the egg into the ground and leaving it there for 2-3 weeks. The ground absorbs bad energies and charges the egg.\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents\n\nIt is important to string the egg before you start. It helps you to remove the egg easily after your exercises by pulling on the string. Use dental floss (unwaxed and tasteless) for stringing. Make sure the floss is long enough.\n\nIt should be approximately as long as the distance between your shoulder and your hand.\n\nThread the two ends into one hole of the egg and pull the ends through the loop. Doing it this traditional way avoids tying a knot. Be careful with removing the egg. You should first try to push it out with your vaginal muscles; slightly pulling the string may help you when your muscles need some help.\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents\n\n\u201cThe first time I used the egg it fell straight out. After three days I could hold it in for 15 minutes while I made the kid\u2019s lunches in the morning. After a week I could hold the egg in for 30 minutes! And then after about a\u00a0month,\u00a0my husband noticed a difference in the tightness of my vagina during sex. Needless to say, he loves it\u201d \u2013 Kristy, 36\n\n\u201cWhen I started to use the egg I noticed how much more lubricated and aroused I felt with it inside me. My libido had been so low for so long. Within a few\u00a0weeks,\u00a0I felt reignited! Using the egg helped me switch on my sex drive and desire myself and my partner more\u201d \u2013 Jen, 47\n\n\u201cI had always struggled to internally orgasm with a partner. After a few months of wearing my yoni egg consistently, I began to feel more sensation during intercourse. And last week I had my first ever G-spot orgasm with my boyfriend and penetration felt so much easeful and satisfying!\u201d \u2013 Ashleigh, 27\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents\n\nThe first step is to take a look at how to prepare your Yoni egg for use.\n\nA Yoni Egg session means time for you and your body. Imagine this is a date with your Yoni. Take your time and prepare it nicely. To be able to include your Yoni Egg sessions in your daily life, make sure to keep the duration of your session not too long, but not too short either. Maybe you can have a longer session (1h) on the weekends, and shorter ones during the week (20-30min).\n\nPrepare yourself a nice, quiet place, where you can work with your egg undisturbed.\n\nDecent music, flowers, a nice blanket, incense sticks, etc. may help you with setting up the atmosphere you desire to get into a deeper connection with your Yoni. It may also feel right for you to have a permanent altar or place where you not only store your egg, but also have your Yoni Egg rituals.\n\nPrepare yourself a welcoming and loving place for your sessions.\n\nBefore you actually start your session you can set an intention for your practice. You can focus on a specific topic or feeling. Visualizing is also helpful here; you can visualize your Yoni being strong, flexible, healed and smooth. Some women also include\u00a0meditations in their Yoni Egg session, to calm down, relax and feel into their body. But in\u00a0general,\u00a0before you actually start working with the egg, make sure you feel comfortable.\n\nAlways make sure that before you insert the egg you warm yourself up first. A great way to do this is with a blissful breast massage. It\u2019ll kick-start love hormones in your body and connects you with your body.\n\nThe breast massage helps to bring gentle arousal energy and thus produce vaginal lubricant, so you can insert the egg easily.\n\nMake sure your vagina is expanded and natural lubricating fluid is being emitted before you put the egg in. So take your time and be your own sesual lover!\n\nLie on your back with your feet\u00a0hip-width\u00a0apart and soles of the feet on the ground. If you produce very little fluid naturally, use a natural lubricant, like organic coconut oil or other organic lubrication.\n\nWhen your Yoni feels ready, insert the Yoni Egg with the wider-end first. It helps to be aroused before inserting the egg, so allow yourself to stimulate your clitoris beforehand to create more lubrication.\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents\n\nWhile you are lying on the floor and have the egg inside of you, feel it first. Try to feel it fully. If you don\u2019t, visualize it inside of you.\n\nThen do pelvic floor and core strengthening exercises with it.\n\nLie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Inhale, engage Yoni muscles and lift your hips. Hold up for 10 seconds (keep breathing!). Lower your hips, exhale and release your pelvic floor muscles. Do two to three sets of 10 repetitions.\n\nLie on your back with your legs straight and together, with your hands tucked under your rear. Raise your legs two feet off the floor, pause, and then lift your legs until they form a right angle with your hips. Hold, and then slowly lower your legs to the floor. Repeat. Do two to three sets of 10 repetitions.\n\nStand with your feet wider than hip-width apart. Bend your knees and squat down as if you were sitting in a chair, until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Keep your abdominal muscles tight and your torso as straight as possible without putting stress on your back. Make sure your knees don\u2019t shoot past your toes. Stand up to return to starting position. Repeat. Do two to three sets of 12 repetitions.\n\nHave your feet and shoulder width apart and firmly grounded, ankles and knees bent, groin folded, spine and neck in alignment. Lift your arms in front of you to a 45-degree angle with your palms facing upwards. Assume a clenched fist position. In the beginning, make sure not to practice on a cement floor (or any other stone or hard floor) so if the egg drops out while practicing, it will not break. You can also place a towel under your feet.\n\nIn this exercise it is important to know about the three sections of the vaginal canal:\n\nFirst Section: External vagina\u2019s orifice to the front of the vaginal canal\n\nSecond Section: The middle vaginal canal\n\nThird Section: Vaginal canal in front of the cervix\n\nYou can do the exercise with the three sections every morning to wake up your body and generate energy for the day. It takes 15-30 minutes.\u00a0There are many other ways to exercise with your egg. You can practice this and more exercises while lying down, sitting or even dancing.\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents\n\nJust feel into your body. Maybe there are some sensations in your Yoni. Give everything you feel after the exercises the space to be there and meet it with acceptance and love. Be thankful.\n\nIf you wish so you can end the session with a ritual.\n\nYou can thank God/yourself for this practice with a dance or just sit down and have a meditation. Make sure to clean your egg afterwards (with water) and store it well. A small pouch may be useful, as well as putting it on your altar.\n\nBy the\u00a0way,\u00a0there is no right or wrong way to set up an altar. Just make up a sacred place that is filled with good energies and supports your personal growth and spiritual journey. You can use shells, incense sticks, figures and statues, pictures, stones, etc.\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents\n\nThere are a few more ways to use the egg and include it in your lifestyle:\n\nYou can use the egg while doing Yoga. There might also be a Yoni egg yoga classes in your city.\n\nExercise during a busy week. In case you don\u2019t have the time to do all those practices mentioned above you can simply insert the egg while you are cleaning your house and just wear it for fun. (Note that the effects of the egg are not as huge if you just wear it without\u00a0practising)\n\nHave you ever had a Yoni massage? The Yoni egg can also be part of this beautiful practice.\n\nVaginal Weight Lifting. Some women also practice weight lifting with the egg. This is a powerful way to train not only the\u00a0Yoni\u00a0but also the areas around it.\n\nPlease use the Yoni egg only when it really feels right for you. Don\u2019t overuse it; it\u2019s not a bodybuilding fitness tool. It is a tool for self-healing.\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents\n\nTo get the benefits of the Yoni egg\u00a0practice, it is really important to work with the egg on a regular basis. Research says we can establish a new habit in our lives after 4-5 weeks. So make sure that you stick to your Yoni egg habit for at least four weeks to have all the positive effects we have talked about, and establish a stable habit.\n\nYou can,\u00a0for example, include the egg in your morning routine, the same way other people go running in the\u00a0morning\u00a0or do Yoga. Be creative with your practice and celebrate your Yoni egg use.\n\nYou can also take your Yoni egg with you when you are travelling, as even in the larger sizes it is still very handy and small. When travelling with the egg, make sure you have it stored well as it could break easily.\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents\n\nPlease don\u2019t store the egg in a messy bottom drawer. The Yoni egg will give you its best service when you take care of it and store it in a nice space.\n\nMake sure you cleanse the egg from time to time.\n\nIt absorbs bad energies throughout your practice that need to be removed. They should not be inside your Yoni every time you use your\u00a0egg\u00a0when you actually wanted to have them removed. As mentioned above, there are several ways to cleanse your egg energetically.\n\nAfter each\u00a0use,\u00a0you can clean the egg with a diluted vinegar solution (one tablespoon per quart of water) and let it dry for at least one hour. If you can\u2019t find vinegar, you can just use water. Please don\u2019t use any alcohol, soap or detergent for cleaning the egg. Your vaginal membranes are very sensitive and you might unknowingly be allergic to any of these.\n\n\u2026back to\u00a0table of contents<|endoftext|>"}
