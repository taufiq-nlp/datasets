Much of what we see in the media concerning prevention of sexual assault is geared towards women (who make up the majority of victims/ survivors). Many articles are written describing\u00a0the\u00a0steps women can take to prevent being sexually assaulted. Some of these steps include never walk alone at night, never take a drink from a stranger, be careful how you dress, safety in numbers. While these are all wonderful reminders (and often necessary in this day and age), they are still victim blaming in nature. They also refute the statistics about sexual assault that say most survivors of sexual assault know their perpetrators. Sexual assault rarely occurs at the hand of a stranger in an a dark alley as movies and TV shows like us to believe.\u00a0The only way to truly prevent sexual assault from occurring is to directly engage with potential perpetrators. And, since most perpetrators are men, I believe that we must start to educate boys around expectations, disappointment, and consent. Not only should sex education in schools include these topics, there are ways we can incorporate these lessons in every day life.\n\nThe ways in which I talk to my kids about love, respect, and body autonomy also embody these values. I teach my children that they do not owe anyone their body. They do not have to hug or kiss any family members just because they love them. My children have complete body autonomy and decide when and who they engage with physically. This does not mean I am not teaching them manners and respect of elders. However, they get to choose how they greet them. They may hug and kiss, shake hands, fist bump or simply nod but they are learning to look people in the eye and acknowledge them respectfully. Feelings of love do not equate to physical interactions. I also ask their permission for physical affection. I do not believe I am entitled to hugs and kisses because I love them. I want them to internalize the fact that simply because you love someone or they love you, does not mean they will want to engage in physical contact with them. At times this is difficult but it also teaches them the concept of body autonomy.\n\nWe also stop any activity once someone says \u201cSTOP\u201d. This was a more difficult lesson for them to learn. They would often yell stop while being tickled and not mean it. But in our house, the word stop (and any other statements like it) are taken very seriously. I want them to know that stop means stop and no means no. I also include the idea of consent and body autonomy when I have to interfere in physical fights between the two. I use language that includes \u201dYou may not touch her body without her permission\u201d and \u201cYou may not touch him in ways that he does not consent to\u201d. I want them to be comfortable with these concepts from a young age.\n\nWe also have conversations about entitlement and ways to deal with and process disappointment. I validate their feelings while helping them to understand that they must earn respect and permission. Disappointment is difficult for children, it\u2019s difficult for some adults as well. They are encouraged to express emotions but they also know that they are not owed anything in this world. As they have gotten older, my kids have come to realize that disappointment is a part of life and they, at times, can use this disappointment to work harder to get the things they desire. They are learning that at times that means giving a person space, or respecting others, not just actively pursuing the things they want. I want my daughter to understand she does not owe anyone her body and I want my son to internalize that he is not owed anything simply because he is male. These are lessons that will serve them well in many aspect of life.\u00a0Until we teach our children these core values, we will continue to see sexual assault at the rates we have seen in the past. Until then, we must continue to provide survivors and potential survivors with the resources they need to protect themselves.\u00a0Additional resources on parenting and sexual abuse and assault prevention can be found here.<|endoftext|>"}

After the trials and tribulations of the last few years, it\u2019s more important than ever to intentionally focus on one\u2019s wellness to avoid burnout. Around the new year, there are frequent conversations about transformation and resolution setting. Before diving into how to set sexual wellness intentions for the new year, it\u2019s important to preface that if resolution-setting doesn\u2019t help you, there is nothing wrong with not doing so. Just staying afloat in chronically stressful societal conditions is a feat in and of itself so if that\u2019s all you have the capacity for, that is more than enough. For those who are yes to sexual wellness goals for the new year, here are 3 steps that can help guide your intention setting.1. Understand what sexual wellness is and what it looks like for youBefore jumping in, it is important to understand what sexual wellness is.\u00a0What is sexual wellness?\u00a0Sexual wellness is emotional and physical satisfaction with regard to one\u2019s sexuality and sexual life. Goals around sexual wellness can be oriented toward one\u2019s sexual relationship with themselves, or with others. Intentionality is an important part of cultivating sexual wellness and forces perpetual self-reevaluation of boundaries and desires. This knowledge is key to reaching sexual wellness goals.\n\n2. Reflect on your current sexual wellness; what is working and what could be improvedBefore setting your intentions, it is a good idea to gauge the current status of your sexual wellness and identify areas where you are already satisfied and areas where you\u2019d like to improve. Use these questions to guide your self-reflection:Questions for reflecting on your sexual wellnessAre you generally satisfied with your current sex life? What do you enjoy about it? What, if anything, do you dislike about it or wish was different?\u00a0Do you have shame around sex and/or your appearance? Where does it come from? How does it affect your sex life, if at all?\u00a0Are you affected by any sexual trauma? Is there any part of that trauma that you\u2019d like to process with a therapist before working on sexual wellness intentions? (Note: focusing on addressing trauma can be a sexual wellness intention, too!)What sexual activities or relationship dynamics do you want to try out that you haven\u2019t yet? What have you already tried, and what did you learn about yourself from those experiences?\u00a0If you have sex involving other people, do you trust and like those people? Do they meet your sexual needs? How is your communication about and during sex?\u00a0Do you already dedicate attention to your own pleasure?\n\n3. Choose your intentions and plan how you\u2019ll achieve themOnce you have a good idea of your sexual needs, boundaries, and desires, use that information to decide what you want your intentions to be. Below is a non-exclusive list of intentions and specific actions you can take to work toward them.Intention ideas\u00a0-To focus on the journey, not the destinationBe more present in your body and with your partnerMake the goal of sex be pleasure and connection rather than orgasmExperiment and try out things you\u2019re curious about-To be honor your needs and your pleasureDon\u2019t lie about having an orgasm if you didn\u2019tAsk for what you want and need from your partner in sexual encountersDon\u2019t leave it to chance; schedule sex and/or masturbation sessions-To try new thingsUse more \u201csexcessories\u201d like lubricant and sex toysDo more kegelsRead more erotica\n\nThis is all a starting point to inspire your intention-setting but everyone\u2019s sexual wellness looks different and will need different types of nurturing. Regardless of whether or not you choose to set intentions for the new year, be sure to take care of your overall wellness, including sexual wellness, regardless. Setting sexual wellness intentions can be done on your own or with a partner. You may also want to consider speaking with a sex therapist if you need help with any of the steps above.

Today marks the 33 year anniversary of this observance, and yet the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS remains present as ever. This stigma fuels a shame-based culture in which it becomes difficult for people with HIV/AIDS to disclose their status without fear of retribution. That being said, it is ethically important to inform sexual and/or romantic partners of pertinent medical information that has the potential to affect them. This applies to HIV/AIDS among other sexually transmitted infections and any contagious conditions. Without everyone being on the same page about everyone\u2019s health status, it\u2019s difficult to ensure proper safety precautions are being taken and that everyone\u2019s boundaries are being respected. In addition to moral implications of disclosure, 35 states have laws that criminalize neglecting to disclose HIV/AIDS status with sexual partners and/or anyone sharing needles. It is undoubtedly important to disclose, but the prospect of doing so can be intimidating for fear of rejection, violence, and judgment from the listening party. Here are some ways to make that conversation as easy as possible when disclosing your status to your partner(s).\n\nSource: https://news.delaware.gov/2018/11/30/delaware-events-mark-world-aids-day-dec-1-2018/\n\n1. Be specific and straightforwardMake sure to disclose the status of the infection including what it is, the definition of the condition, and what, if anything, you need from the other person in terms of supportIf it would be helpful, you can disclose with the help of your doctor or therapist\u00a02. Plan ahead for all possible reactionsMake sure you have support systems and coping mechanisms in place to navigate the possibility of an adverse reactionSpeak to a therapist and/or have the disclosure discussion with a counselor or therapistRespect the needs of the recipient for their processing of the newsWhile you should respect the needs of the other person, make sure you know what you need in terms of emotional regulation and allow yourself the grace to feel negative emotions if they come up\u00a03. Come prepared with educational and safety resources about the relevant health statusWhen discussing a condition with a risk of transmission, one of the first concerns that comes to mind is the health and safety of everyone involved. A good way to navigate the fear is to make sure everyone involved in the conversation has the resources and support they need.Resources for someone living with HIV/AIDSRyan White HIV/AIDS Program\u201cThe Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program works with cities, states, and local community-based organizations. The Program provides primary medical care and essential support services to more than half a million people each year. Through the Program, people living with HIV who have no insurance or are underinsured can get the HIV medical care and other support services they need.\u201d\u00a0CDC \u201cSharing Your Test Result\u201d\u00a0Send an anonymous STD test notification to sexual partners\u00a0This is a good option to inform casual or past partners, but in a serious relationship, it\u2019s probably better to discuss it in person to navigate the implications for the relationshipResources for someone who has a loved one living with HIV/AIDS\u00a0\u00a0CDC HIV prevention tips\u00a0\u00a0Living with an HIV Positive Partner (Flo Health)AIDS | Definition, Diagnosis, Treatment, & FactsLiving with any chronic illness like HIV/AIDS is difficult in many ways, disclosure being just one of them. Hopefully these resources prove helpful in easing the process. Regarding HIV/AIDS specifically, though there\u2019s no cure, a diagnosis is not the end of the world. It can be managed with medication such as antiretroviral therapies and safer sex practices. Disclosing your status to the people in your life not only keeps them informed of any potential implications for their health, but they can also be a shoulder to lean on.<|endoftext|>"}

The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues have increased significantly. Thousands of people lost employment, and even more lives have been lost due to COVID-19 or COVID-19 related complications. Many parents are feeling the pressure of balancing working from home while simultaneously managing their children\u2019s remote learning. Social isolation has resulted in chronic loneliness and boredom which can be detrimental to our mental health and wellbeing. People are also struggling to connect more than ever. The sudden cataclysmic events have brought to light the frightening realization that spending time alone was not something we were prepared for. Below are just a few ways to support your mental health this year:\n\nSource: Gunshow Comic\n\n1. Start a HobbyStaying productive and starting a new hobby can have a positive effect on your mood. Hobbies come in all shapes and sizes and budgets! The benefits of engaging in a new hobby are numerous. Having a hobby can help get you out of work mode and take you out of your everyday routine. Some hobbies such as online video games, require a social element which can help ease feelings of loneliness. What\u2019s most important is to find a hobby that brings you pleasure.\n\nSource: Buzzfeed\n\n2. Find Meaning in Each DayAt the beginning of the pandemic, people were panic-buying supplies out of a fear of scarcity. The need to feel safe, secure, and find some sense of purpose when isolated helped many sustain some semblance of normalcy. Viktor Emil Frankl, a Austrian psychiatrist and psychotherapist said, \u201clife is never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose.\u201d When it is impossible to change your surroundings, you are challenged to change yourself and your cognitions. Frankl reiterated that you can find meaning by expressing yourself creatively, interacting authentically with your surroundings, and changing your attitude about a situation.\u00a03. Make Self Care a PriorityAccording to the International Journal of Nursing Studies, having a self care routine contributes positively to mental health and can lead to a longer life. The World Health Organization defines self care as the ability to promote, prevent, and maintain your health with or without the support of a healthcare provider. Self care can look differently for everyone -- it is generally best to experiment to discover what works best for you.\u00a0Some examples of self care include:Moving your body. This could look like engaging in some gentle stretching, going for a walk, or dancing around your home. Research shows that engaging in aerobic exercise can boost self esteem and promote mental wellbeing.\u00a0Getting quality sleep. Giving yourself the opportunity to rest and recharge is essential for your mental health.Taking a break from screens. Excessive screen time has been shown to have negative effects on mental health.\u00a0Meditating. Incorporating meditation or mindfulness meditation into your day can improve cognitive function and feelings of overall well being.\u00a0Taking in natural sunlight. Your circadian rhythm signals your body when to sleep, and when to be active. Controlling your exposure to sunlight or bright lights can help you sleep better at night and wake up refreshed.\u00a0Baking a new recipe. Baking is a great way to express creativity and practice mindfulness which can reduce stress.Tending to your garden or house plants. Snake plants can survive with minimal amounts of care and they help filter the air. Even better, fill your home with cacti, as long as they get some light they don\u2019t care if you forget about them for a while. According to Jennifer Scriven, a Business Development Manager at Axcess Merchant Services, having cacti on your desk can increase productivity and reduce stress.\u00a0Whatever you decide to do, be compassionate with yourself through this process until you find what works best for your needs. Reducing your stress and focusing on improving your mental health will benefit not only you, but those around you. Gradually incorporate these changes to prioritize your mental health and stay motivated.<|endoftext|>"}

If you haven\u2019t seen it, get to it! It\u2019s a smart, charming series surrounding Otis Milburn, a teenager at an English high school, who uses the wisdom passed on from his sex therapist mother to help his classmates with a variety of sexual topics, in exchange for a small fee. As you can guess, it\u2019s not always that simple and Otis must come to terms with his own sex life and all that comes with it.\u00a0Season Two has featured many great, unheralded sexual topics through its cast of characters. These are the four topics I\u2019m totally pumped they covered this season.*Warning, spoilers ahead*1. Sexual Trauma Episode ThreeAimee, the caring but often na\u00efve classmate of Otis is riding the bus to school as she always does when a stranger publicly masturbates and ejaculates on her pants, causing her to get off the crowded bus. Thinking of it nothing more than an annoying way to ruin a great pair of jeans, her friend, Maeve, urges her to go to the police station and file a report. Once Aimee realizes that the situation she experienced was sexual assault, her attitude begins to change and symptoms of sexual trauma emerge. Aimee becomes terrified of the bus, repelled by physical touch, even with her partner, and confides in her friends for help.With the prevalence of sexual assault affecting over 80% of women in their lifetime, talking about sexual trauma is more important than ever. It is also common for survivors of sexual trauma to experience physical symptoms such as difficulty sleeping, feeling disconnected from one\u2019s body, loss of control, as well as increased depression and anxiety. Young women are particularly at risk, with current estimates indicating that 1 in 5 college-aged women will experience sexual harassment on campus. While the reality of these statistics is stark, it is important that survivors of sexual trauma can get connected with the care and resources they need. To learn more about how to support survivors, checkout the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline, and a local hotline.\n\n2. Asexuality Episode FourFlorence, the a-bit-out-there star of the school production of Romeo and Juliet begins receiving pressure from her classmates to try to sleep with Jackson, the heart throb college bound jock turned thespian co-star. It is then that Florence realizes that she doesn\u2019t just not want to have sex with Jackson, she doesn\u2019t want to have sex with anyone. When she describes her feelings as \u201csurrounded by a huge feast of everything I\u2019ve wanted to eat, but I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d Dr. Milburn explains the concept of asexuality.Asexuality is a sexual orientation that refers to a person who does not experience sexual attraction. We are so glad that Sex Education is increasing the visibility of asexuality, particularly because asexuality can be misunderstood and underrepresented in media. People who identify as asexual may also experience romantic or sensual attraction. Sexuality exists on a continuum and there are nuances to what each individual may experience. To learn more about asexuality and the ACE community, checkout The Asexuality Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), the world\u2019s largest online community providing wonderful resources on asexuality.\n\n3. Douching Episode SixWhen Anwar, the snobby but sexually vulnerable classmate of Otis, begins exploring anal sex with his boyfriend for the first time, he becomes anxious when he questions the cleanliness of his anus. He makes up an excuse to not proceed with the encounter, then asks Otis if he knows anything about how to douche.Douching is the practice of cleansing and washing the body, in particular the genitals. The word douche, in French, means to shower -- a natural translation. Most commonly, people discuss the practice of vaginal or rectal or anal douching. Anal douching is commonly practiced to eliminate bacteria in the anus, which makes some people feel more comfortable before engaging in anal sex. Some experts warn against anal douching due to the possibility of injury and because certain cleansing agents can interfere with the electrolytes in the body by removing healthy intestinal flora that otherwise promote healthy gut health. If you are going to douche, make sure to educate yourself on the risks and engage in safety practices.\n\n4. Vaginismus Episode EightFinally, in the season finale, Ola and Lily have finally begun exploring their feelings for each other and attempt digital penetration. It is then when Lily reveals to Ola that she suffers from vaginismus, which makes her vagina \u201clike a venus fly trap.\u201d\u2018Closing up like a venus fly trap\u2019 may not be the best clinical description of vaginismus, but for some, the spasm-like response resonates. Vaginismus is defined as the recurrent or persistent involuntary contractions (spasm) of vaginal muscles that generally results in distress and pain during sex, specifically with any type of vaginal penetration. Sexuality education, pelvic floor physical therapy, and sex therapy can be effective treatment options for vaginismus. Vaginal dilators, which were also showcased in the episode, are often incorporated during pelvic floor physical therapy to help strengthen vaginal elasticity. While not thrilled that Lily was experiencing physical discomfort during sex, I am pleased to see that vaginismus is being brought to the forefront.\n\nI\u00a0 love a show that normalizes very, well, normal sexual issues, behaviors, disorders and methods and brings them into the consciousness of the open public. Sex Education is not only funny, entertaining, sweet but also very accurate and important toward breaking sexual stigmas and learning how to talk about topics that affect us all. Way to go Netflix!<|endoftext|>"}

Gender identity is one\u2019s internal sense of gender, whether that\u2019s woman, man, neither, or both. For most people, gender identity aligns with their sex assigned at birth but for some, like transgender and non-binary people, this is not the case. Gender expression is the outward presentation, via behavior, appearance, and other characteristics, of one\u2019s internal sense of gender. Both identity and presentation are rife for exploration from a young age and it\u2019s important to a young person\u2019s development to have a strong support network. It\u2019s okay to not know exactly what that might entail which is why we created this guide to get you started.\n\n1) Create a safe, judgment-free, validating environment for gender explorationMake it both explicitly and implicitly (through behavior) clear that your child can come to you with any questions or concerns about gender without fear of repercussion. Aside from explicitly telling them this, you will convey acceptance by \u201cshowing not telling\u201d in how you treat others. Furthermore, adults sometimes have a tendency not to believe children about gender questioning because they\u2019re \u201ctoo young\u201d but doing so will only alienate them from you. Validate their thoughts, questions, and concerns, and if you\u2019re feeling out of your depth, consider consulting a psychologist if that\u2019s financially feasible for you.\n\n2) Teach your child how to respect others\u2019 gender identityThis is an important step regardless of your child\u2019s gender identity/presentation. That being said, it\u2019s extra important if your child is displaying signs of not aligning with their sex at birth because it teaches them both how to respect others, and how others should be respecting them. Some examples of teaching your child to respect others\u2019 gender are:Introduce yourself with pronouns to encourage others to share theirs while in front of your child. With people you have an established relationship with, it may be appropriate to directly ask for their pronouns. However, with strangers, you don\u2019t know if doing so puts them in an uncomfortable position by forcing them to out themselves or by them intentionally telling you the wrong pronouns (misgendering themselves) to avoid outing themselves in front of others.Talking to your child about the idea that all gender expression is valid, regardless of whether or not it aligns with our idea of what someone of that gender \u201cshould\u201d look likeGently correct people when they misgender someone you know, and teach your child how to do so as wellTeach them about and debunk gender stereotypes, such as the idea that only women should cook and only men should be breadwinners\n\n3) Introduce them to diverse mediaSome suggestions of media reflecting diverse gender roles and identities areThe Bravest Knight (Show)Steven Universe (Show)\u00a0First Day (Show\u00a0Over the Moon (Film)\u00a0The Most Dangerous Year (Film)\u00a0Little Girl (Film)Local drag queen story hour events or try a YouTube version\n\n4) If financially feasible, consider seeing a psychologistIf you\u2019re feeling unequipped to assist your child in their exploration, the best thing you can do is give them tools to help. One such tool is finding a child psychologist, preferably specializing in gender. This person can be a resource not only for your child, but for you too, and they can give more specific advice for supporting your child.\n\nBy reading this article, you\u2019ve already taken a step towards being a supportive of your child\u2019s gender exploration. It\u2019s okay to feel unequipped or unsure - gender is ambiguous and confusing even for the most expert among us. The most important part is making sure you cultivate an accepting and validating environment because if your child can\u2019t even talk to you about their concerns, your involvement in their exploration has ended before it\u2019s even begun.<|endoftext|>"}

Sometimes buying one can be an intimidating task with so many options and a lack of information available due to stigma. Never fear though because Embrace Sexual Wellness has compiled a buying guide to help you find the best match for your personal needs.First of all, you need to identify what is important to you in a sex toy. Here are some questions you should ask yourself before embarking on your search:\u00a0Do you want to be able to use this toy on just yourself, or with partners too? (If you plan on sharing, make sure you take appropriate safety precautions).\u00a0Do you have any sensitivities to materials like silicone or latex that need to be taken into consideration?What\u2019s your budget?\u00a0Are you interested in something that vibrates or not?Do you need a toy that is waterproof to take in the bath or shower?If you\u2019re interested in vibration, do you want pinpointed sensations or broader stimulation?\u00a0Once you have your answers, you can begin your search in earnest. To get you started, let\u2019s talk about the most popular kinds of sex toys. Please note that regardless of what toys you opt for, it\u2019s essential to take care of them properly. Here is a helpful guide that goes over how to clean sex toys.\n\nDildos Dildos are insertable objects that are most commonly phallic shaped but there are also tons of fantasy and abstract options available too! They come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. Some are smooth, while others have texture. Some vibrate and some don\u2019t. Some can attach to a wearer like a strap\u2013on, while others are handheld. Some even have suction cups so they can stick to flat surfaces like a shower or a bedroom wall. Dildos are a highly versatile item that can be used for penetration, for external stimulation or rubbing on the genitals, or even for gender affirmation.\n\nVibratorsVibrators are \u201cobjects that vibrate (move continuously/buzz) to stimulate your genitals. Vibrators are often used on genitals but can really be used anywhere that feels good on any anatomy! Popular types of vibrators are bullet, suction, and wand. Bullet vibrators are good for pinpointed stimulation and portability; suction vibrators are a unique sensation that is distinct from other vibrators because they use air pulsation instead or in addition to vibration; and wand vibrators, perhaps the most well known, are good for high powered broad stimulation.\n\nAnal ToysFrom butt plugs to anal beads to anal-sex-specific dildos, anal toys come in all shapes and sizes. Here is a guide detailing the differences between your options. Regardless of what you opt for, EVERY anal toy you use must have a flared base (a base that is significantly wider than the insertable portion of the toy). The flared base ensures that the toy won\u2019t go too far up inside the body and if it does go in too far, it may necessitate an unpleasant visit to the emergency room.\n\nStrokers and Penis RingsThe most popular stroker is known as the Fleshlight but these days there are dozens of options to choose from. Some are heated or vibrating, some are textured, and all of them are fun ways to enhance penis play! Another popular sex toy commonly used by people with penises are penis rings which \u201cslow blood flow out of the penis when it\u2019s erect, which can increase sensation, or make your erection harder and longer-lasting.\u201d\n\nFinally, something incredibly important to take into account during your sex toy search is that sex toys are not carefully regulated like food or medication products so it\u2019s up to the individual consumer to ensure safety. Here are some things you should look for in terms of safety. Do NOT purchase sex toys from websites like Amazon or eBay as they have been known to sell inauthentic and even used items.

This leaves many of us struggling to understand our own sexuality independently which can be messy and frustrating. Furthermore, experiencing sexual shame on an independent level means it\u2019s difficult to internalize that you aren\u2019t the only one struggling with a certain issue. The first step to unlearning this shame is by acknowledging that it exists and then you can begin to unpack it. Let\u2019s address some common sources of sexual shame together.\n\n1. Not being able to achieve orgasm in a specific way or at allThis is more commonly spoken about as an issue that women struggle with (an estimated 10-15% of women experience orgasmic dysfunction) but anyone can experience difficulty attaining orgasm. There are many potential roots of the problem including, but not limited to sexual trauma, age, hormones, mental and chronic illness, and certain medications. Whether or not there is a clear root of the problem, there is nothing wrong with you for experiencing difficulty attaining orgasm. Societal expectations and misinformation is the source of the shame, your body is not inherently shameful and you did not do anything \u201cwrong\u201d to \u201cdeserve\u201d this. Most important to remember, you do not need to be able to orgasm in order to enjoy sex and masturbation.\n\n2. Not being interested in intercourse, but interested in other sexual/sensual activitiesHeteronormative expectations of sex center around penetrative sex; it is posited as the goal of sex. Unfortunately, this is exclusionary to many people like queer people, people who experience sexual dysfunction, or just anyone who does not derive pleasure from penetrative sex. Aside from being exclusionary, it\u2019s limiting for everyone who has internalized that expectation. Once we are able to unlearn heteronormative expectations of sex (easier said than done!), so many doors open in terms of sexual possibility. Intercourse is just one of many ways to enjoy sex and it is not the sole \u201cright\u201d way to have sex.\n\n3. Having responsive desire rather than spontaneous desire\n\nGenerally speaking there are two main types of how people experience a desire to have sex. Responsive desire means someone often needs to experience physical arousal before experiencing mental desire while spontaneous desire means someone often feels mental desire before physical arousal. Mainstream media and societal expectations posit spontaneous desire as the \u201cnorm,\u201d leaving those with responsive desire to feel like something is wrong with them. Neither is superior, they are simply different. If you are struggling with your desire type being compatible with your partner(s), check out this Embrace Sexual Wellness blog post on desire discrepancy.\n\n4. Experiencing sexual dysfunction or painSimilarly to orgasmic dysfunction, it\u2019s hard not to feel \u201cbroken\u201d for experiencing sexual dysfunction or pain, especially if it prohibits you from having the kind of sex you want to have. It makes sense to grieve the fact that your body cannot do something that you wish that it could. At the same time, it\u2019s integral to remember that you still deserve to have enjoyable sex and that it is still possible, even if that means it won\u2019t look the way you expected.\n\nThe source of the shame related to the reasons above is because of the limiting societal expectations and beliefs about sex. The problem does not lie in the individual, but in the inaccurate and exclusionary ways we learn and talk about sex. You are not alone in your challenges. If you find yourself struggling to address your sexual shame alone, consider reaching out to Embrace Sexual Wellness and one of our sexuality professionals will happily help guide you through it.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "embracesexualwellness", "text": "<|endoftext|>4 Things to Include In Your At-Home Sex Education\n\n\n\nA majority of schooling is now remote, and many parents and educators have adapted to new methods of teaching. While some may view this as a deterrent to learning, it can also be an opportunity to refine curricula and make education more inclusive. Sex education is a wonderful place to start.\u00a0Only 30 U.S. states require sex education and only 17 of those states require it to be medically accurate. This is not an encouraging number considering that if students do not receive scientifically accurate sex education, they may be inclined to go to the internet to learn, and information on the internet is not always accurate.\u00a0Here are some things to keep in mind when teaching sex education at home:1. Use Inclusive Language When Referring to Gender Identity and Sexual/Romantic OrientationIt is critical to use language and provide information that is inclusive of all individuals\u2019 gender identities and sexual/romantic orientations when teaching sex ed at home. This means making sure that the content you are teaching shares information that pertains to LGBTQ+ youth. Young people deserve to see their identities represented.Since only 11 U.S. states require sex education to be LGBTQ+ inclusive and 7 require only negative information to be taught about homosexuality, many students are missing important information that not only validates their identity, but also teaches safer sex that is applicable to their lives. Furthermore, curricula that center the experiences of LGBTQ+ youth is actually encompassing to all youth. Conversations surrounding contraceptive options and barrier methods such as dental dams, as well as internal and external condoms to prevent the transmission of STIs are important for everyone. Introducing terms that reflect sexual diversity normalizes the variety of identities people can hold and helps youth understand what they mean. Promoting allyship and acceptance helps youth understand the variety of ways people experience attraction, both romantically and sexually, encourages them to think about their own gender expression, gender identity, and how that identity may be similar or different from their sex assigned at birth.By teaching and modeling inclusive language during your at-home sex education, children will understand that including or making fun of peers based on their identities is harmful and stigmatizing. Stigma can lead LGBTQ+ youth to be at risk of a variety of negative health outcomes including higher rates of STIs, unwanted pregnancy, and suicide attempts.\n\n2. Broaden the Conversation From Just SexWhen speaking with children about sexuality, it is also important to speak about healthy relationships and connections with others. A 2018 article published by Harvard University stresses the importance of teaching processes to care for one another in order for students to learn how to both support a partner in a relationship and engage in a healthy relationship.\u00a0The National Sexual Education Standards emphasize these themes as well. The standards define a healthy relationship as, \u201ca relationship between individuals that consists of mutual respect, trust, honesty, support, fairness/equity, separate identities, physical and emotional safety, and good communication.\u201d The theme of healthy relationships is constant in these standards, but\u00a0 the topics differ by grade, so it can be helpful to look through their guidelines for support.SIECUS, an organization focusing on sex ed for social change, also emphasizes the importance of including topics of communication and healthy relationships in sex education.\u00a0A good place to begin is the concept of mutuality. Mutuality is the ability to make decisions with a partner and understand and address their concerns or wishes. It is extremely important to teach youth the importance of open communication within both sexual and non-sexual relationships.For example, let\u2019s say a child is going to the park with their friend. Their friend wants to play on the monkey bars and they want to play soccer on the field. The child can explain why they want to play soccer and their friend can explain why they want to play on the monkey bars. The children can then reach a compromise and say that they will spend 30 minutes doing each activity. By reaching a compromise the child is learning the importance of having conversations and making compromises in relationships. This teaches children fairness and models the ability to adapt.Talk to your kids about what a healthy relationship looks like. Not all healthy relationships look the same, but some aspects of healthy relationships are adaptability, open communication, trust, and curiosity. Kids look up to adults, so by giving them concrete examples as well as tools, they will likely be able to understand just what a healthy relationship looks like. A good way to teach your children about healthy relationships is by modeling, aka by watching you. Your children will inevitably end up imitating you in some way, so by modeling these healthy behaviors, your children will learn by observing.\u00a0An example of modeling trust in a relationship is honoring your word to take your children to the park. If you say you are going to take your child to the park after school, do it so that they can see the importance of trust in a relationship.\n\n3. Emphasize PleasureThe majority of sex ed curricula focus on the prevention of STIs, HIV and pregnancy. Sex education can also emphasize the importance of pleasure in sexual interactions.UNESCO, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, recommends teaching children about pleasure stating that \u201csexual feelings, fantasies and desires are natural and not shameful.\u201d This is something that is currently not spoken about in a majority of sex ed programs.\u00a0The reality is that many people are having sex for pleasure, so emphasize the importance of pleasure, to create a more open and honest educational environment.The concept of pleasure does not need to be purely sexual. Let\u2019s go back to the park example. The two children were compromising and learning the skill of mutuality, but they were also making room for each other to do something pleasurable. Teaching children about pleasure can help them in their current daily lives, as well as one day in their sexual relationships. There is a link between both pleasure and happiness and pleasure and motivation, so by learning the value of consent, children can begin to prioritize pleasure in their own lives.\n\n4. Prioritize ConsentA large gap in sex education curricula is teaching about consent. Only 9 U.S. states require the importance of consent during sexual activities be covered in sex education. Sex without consent is sexual assault, yet consent is not spoken about in a majority of classrooms.\u00a0When teaching sex education at home, remember to prioritize consent. Assault can lead to mental illness such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Consent is a key ingredient in sexual pleasure. To learn more about consent read our latest blog post, \u201cThe Importance of Consent During a Pandemic.\u201dTeaching consent in sex education will not only help children when it comes to sexual respect and safety but will help with their overall respect for others as well. For any situation, it is important to make sure that both parties are consenting to any activity being done.\u00a0A simple way to teach consent is through the behavior of drinking tea with a friend. Here is an example.You offer your friend a cup of tea...\u201cwould you care for a cup of tea?\u201dIf they respond saying, \u201cOf course! Thank you! I would love a cup of tea!\u201d they are consenting to you giving them tea. If they respond with \u201cI am not sure,\u201d you can ask them a follow-up question or assume that \u201cI am not sure\u201d really means \u201cno\u201d.\u00a0 And if you made the tea and they then decided they didn\u2019t want to drink it, you cannot and should not encourage them to drink it. In this case, your friend is open to the idea of tea but has not yet consented to drinking it. If they reply, \u201cno thank you\u201d then they do not want tea and you should not make it for them. In this case, they are not consenting to drinking tea.\n\nYou can also use the idea of Ask, Listen, Respect to teach younger children about consent.\u00a0The National Sexual Education Standards (NSES) also include content focused on consent. The NSES recommend beginning conversations about consent in kindergarten by focusing on the idea of bodily autonomy, which is the right for each person to govern what happens to their body without external influence or coercion. They aim to lay the groundwork for understanding sexual relationships later on, as well as ensuring a safer classroom environment.Here is a video by Amaze if you want to learn more about consent.---Looking for some extra support to guide your conversations with your children? Checkout our latest e-course here.Here are some resources from Planned Parenthood to guide you through the process of teaching sex education. These resources include an online chat feature, digital education tools such as quizzes and games, and videos about consent.SIECUS has some wonderful resources sorted by age range as well! There are resources for younger children beginning at age 4, resources for young adults, and resources for parents and caregivers.\u00a0Remember that remote learning is new for a lot of people, so it is a-okay if the words you share are not perfect. The key thing is that you are teaching important and engaging topics. You don\u2019t have to strive for perfection, instead strive for smaller moments of learning and growth.Photo credit: Dainis Graveris on Sexual Alpha<|endoftext|>"}

So why does bringing your significant other along make you want to run? Sometimes things that are supposed to be exciting like Thanksgiving dinner or holiday parties with the entire family are particularly stressful.Let\u2019s say you are anticipating that your mom is going to comment on how you still haven\u2019t lost the \u201cfreshman fifteen\u201d you have been hanging onto since college and your dad is going to try to have a serious conversation about your future, suddenly the upcoming holiday celebrations don\u2019t sound so exciting. Add a stubborn grandparent, a dysfunctional aunt and uncle and a younger cousin who always boasts about their achievements in your face to the mix. Sounding fun yet?So bringing your special someone as a guest to your family holiday celebrations might stir some things up for you and that is a-okay. Here are some tips to help you survive this holiday season riding the love train and not the stress express.Give Them A Scouting Report. Run through everyone your significant other will be meeting so it will feel less overwhelming when they walk in the door. If there are a lot of names to remember, try using a pen and paper to draw out the family tree or look at family photos.Make an S.O.S. Plan, Just In Case. Intentionally plan for stressful moments to happen. This way, you adjust your expectations so you can work together if sh*t hits the fan. For example, if you know certain topics (i.e. the election) will cause your special someone\u2019s blood pressure to skyrocket, discuss an exit plan for you to step in if they are feeling overwhelmed. On the other hand, if you have beef with a relative, now is the time to tell your S.O. which person \u201cnot to piss off\u201d and in what circumstances you might be on edge or need some extra support.Expect ALL Of The Relationship Questions: How long have you been together? Where did you meet? What was your first date like? Relatives love to ask about your relationship for a million reasons, especially those curious younger children. So, prepare yourselves in advance by playing the \u201c20 Questions\u201d game to help one another feel confident in your responses.Review The House Rules. Rituals and traditions are important to some families. If your family says Grace before Thanksgiving dinner and your guest is not religious, let them know so they can decide if they want to participate. Make sure to give your S.O. the heads up about any topics that are off limits or whether foul language is permitted.Beware of Sensitivities. If your S.O. is super introverted or has a low tolerance for large groups of people, you might consider initiating one-on-one conversations with a few of your relatives who share common interests as opposed to a table with everyone. Or, if you know your family members are carnivores and your partner is vegan, now might be a good time to talk about bringing a Field Roast or some dairy-free eggnog.Just remember to introduce your guest\u2026 Ahead of time! Tell your family about your S.O. by sharing your top five favorite things about them. Keep it brief, but make sure you emphasize that they will be coming with you to the celebration and it is important to you that they feel welcomed. Plus, the host will appreciate this as they are probably taking a head count for dinner and will want to know much food to prepare.Now, you are ready to relax and enjoy the holiday season!<|endoftext|>"}

So much so to the point that we know we should be caring for ourselves but are lost on where to even start. At the end of the day, people are talking about it for a reason and connecting to our needs is paramount to exploring and finessing our vibrant, holistic selves. One of the most salient and yet least talked about are sexual needs. Here are five ways you can take care of your sexual self:\n\n1) Connect with your body outside of sexually charged contextsYour sensual self is always a part of you. Yes, even when sex is the last thing on your mind! At the end of the day, sex is a bodily experience that can be experienced with presence and intention. Just as a musician will care for their instrument daily, our bodies respond well to fine-tuning. Here are some ideas for body connection:Daily movement - walking is a great place to startDancing - I personally love to put on my favorite song(s) and follow the impulses in my body to move in whatever way feels goodStretching, yoga, and pilates\n\n2) PamperingPampering is a great way to feel sexy. This may include manipulating body hair in a way that feels good to you, exfoliating your body with a scrub, or self-massage. Great places to start with self-massage would be your hands, feet, and scalp, then explore from there!\n\n3) Schedule sexual intimacyYou may be thinking \u201cBoo! Scheduling sex isn\u2019t fun!\u201d to which I\u2019d respond, \u201cWell, at least the people scheduling sex are getting some\u201d \ud83d\udc40 If it is important to you, sex, like most things in your life, needs to be prioritized. Scheduling sex can be seen as lacking spontaneity but a quick reframe to see it as an exciting thing on the calendar can do the trick! Scheduling sex may be with a partner or partners, but you can also schedule solo play. Putting these encounters on your schedule gives you a chance to prepare emotionally, spiritually, physically, etc. to be in a place where you can engage in the scheduled activity with ease and intention.\n\n4) Switch it upMuscle memory serves us positively in a lot of ways, but the other side of that coin is limiting ourselves to a small set of sexual likes that we adhere strongly too. A huge aspect of sexual self-care is to have an openness to your sexuality which requires a healthy dose of curious exploration. Here are some ideas on how you can switch it up:Explore your own erogenous zones with varying types of touch, texture, and pressureUse your other hand when masturbatingSlow Down \u2013 just because you had to frantically finish self-pleasure as a kid, doesn\u2019t mean you have to engage in the same frantic mindset as an adult. Think about the many elements of music that come together to make a song, this is the breadth of possibilities you have in front of you. Your time with yourself could be an insurance commercial or it could be a top hit. Give yourself permission to take time to create your own masterpiece.\n\n5) Share your discoveries\u00a0We have a lot at our fingertips and unfortunately a comprehensive sexual education isn\u2019t one of them. This lack of education has led to a large percentage of our population experiencing some level of shame connected with sex or sexual desires. Brene Brown teaches that the antidote to shame is empathy, and a fast track to empathy is sharing (and of course listening). As you engage in some of the suggestions outlined above, share your experiences with a safe partner, friend, or loved one. This might be one the most important acts of sexual self-care: pursue your sexual self-care and share your discoveries.\n\nWritten By: Seth Taylor, MFT (he/him/his)<|endoftext|>"}

If you learned false information about sex, we are here to help.\u00a0Generalizations are often made leaving some to feel confused or harmed by the information given to them. Today on the Embrace Sexual Wellness blog, we will be debunking some of the myths you may have learned about sex.\u00a0Myth #1: Orgasm is the be-all-and-end-all of sexHaving an orgasm can be a wonderful sensation, but it does not have to be the goal of all sexual interactions. Sex is so much more than the moment of orgasm. It is about pleasure and connection with your partner(s). Consider this, what would it be like if you thought about sexual pleasure as a journey and not a destination?Thinking about orgasm as the goal of sex can also lead to increased stress, not pleasure. According to a study published in Hippokratia, when one feels pressure to perform sexually, their body activates its sympathetic nervous system, which results in the increased production of stress hormones, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol. These hormones increase blood pressure levels and reduce blood flow to the genitals, which can lead to sexual functioning problems (e.g., decreased sensation in the vulva, erectile dysfunction, inhibited arousal), as well as a more stressful sexual dynamic between partners.Orgasms are not a given in all sexual interactions and this pressure to perform can lead to added stress. A 2020 study in Current Sexual Health Reports notes that the orgasm gap still exists. The orgasm gap is the phenomenon that in heterosexual relationships, male partners orgasm at higher rates than their female counterparts. Furthermore, the experience of orgasm can be limiting. A theory in an article published in Current Sexual Health Reports states that those with penises are more likely to reach orgasm since they are taught from a young age that it is okay to explore their bodies more than those with vulvas. Additionally, the research suggests that the cultural prioritization of penile-vaginal intercourse over more clitorally focused sexual activities is linked to the orgasm gap.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, an article in Healthline emphasizes the importance of pleasure during sex aside from an orgasm. The article also notes that when focusing on achieving orgasm alone, safety, well-being, respect, and connection are neglected.\u00a0TLDR: Orgasms are wonderful, but they are not the be-all-and-end-all.\n\nMyth #2: Sex = vaginal penetration\u00a0The heteronormative idea that sex is simply vaginal penetration is incorrect. According to Teen Health Source, a Planned Parenthood Canadian-run sexual health information service for teens, the definition of sex is flexible. Being sexual means different things to different people, and only you get to decide how you define being sexual. Sex can include a range of activities that feel sexual and pleasurable to you.Research inspired by Alfred Kinsey that was published in PLOS ONE, indicates that there are many common sexual behaviors including but not limited to vaginal sex, oral sex, anal sex, sending and receiving nude images, and masturbation. Assuming that sex is only vaginal penetration is exclusionary to those who do not have vaginal sex, or cannot for health reasons. By expanding our definitions of sex, we can make sex more inclusive to people across all identities.\n\nMyth #3: A person with a vulva pops their cherry when they have sex for the first timeDid you ever hear the phrase \u201cpopping one\u2019s cherry\u201d? The phrase popping your cherry tends to apply to the belief that an intact hymen is an indicator if someone with a vulva has engaged in vaginal intercourse. According to an article in Women\u2019s Health magazine, many still believe that an intact hymen is a sign of purity. Well, guess what? Popping one\u2019s cherry is not an accurate phrase in determining if someone has engaged in vaginal intercourse or is \u201cpure\u201d.The hymen is a membrane that lines the opening of the vagina and varies in its size and shape. According to Medical News Today, many people with vulvas do not experience tearing of the hymen during sexual intercourse and sometimes hymens are torn during other non-sexual physical activities, such as horseback riding, riding bicycles, gymnastics, and inserting tampons. In fact, according to a study published in the North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, some people with vaginas do not have hymen to begin with which means that they never will \u201cpop their cherry\u201d.\u00a0A person does not \u201cpop their cherry\u201d and a \u201cpopped cherry\u201d does not mean a person is no longer pure. There has never been validity to these messages.\n\nMyth #4: Virginity is an accurate concept (CW: Sexual Violence and Racism)In her book Virgin: The Untouched History, Hanne Blank, shares that humans have constructed the idea of virginity. This concept, that almost always focuses on females in heterosexual sexual encounters, has been used as an exploitative force for political and cultural forces. In fact, in the Renaissance and Medieval periods, western virginity was symbolized by whiteness and nonwhite people were viewed as sexually immoral. European colonizers also used the concept of virginity to sexually abuse Black women. A 2016 article published in Black & Gold, discusses how Black women were hyper sexualized by white men in order to justify raping and dehumanizing them. The idea of virginity was critical in this historical narrative to justify that white women were pure while Black women were viewed as impure.The concept of virginity is problematic because it teaches women that their virginity (a.k.a. their sexual behavior) is a commodity for men. Women are often shamed for being sexual, a.k.a. \u201closing their virginity\u201d, while men are praised for doing so. This sexist ideology that it is okay for men to have sex, but not for women can lead to slut-shaming.\u00a0\u00a0Virginity is important to some people who choose to engage in abstinence (often defined as waiting to have sex until marriage) or secondary abstinence (waiting to have sex until marriage after having sex prior). According to a study published in Sexuality & Culture, secondary virginity is based on the social construction of gendered sexuality and heterosexuality. This idea of secondary virginity is often infused with conservative Christian ideology, but for some, it is simply a method to protect against pregnancy and STIs. For others, it is a commitment to wait until they are emotionally connected to someone, in some cases waiting to have sex until marriage.\u00a0The term \u2018virgin\u2019 is typically used to describe a person who has never had sex, but this is also challenging since the definition of sex is ambiguous. According to Planned Parenthood, the concept of virginity is inaccurate because everyone defines sex differently and the term is not helpful in determining if someone was sexually active or not. Only you can decide if you are a virgin, but it doesn\u2019t need to matter or hold value unless you want it to. Sexuality professionals recommend using less loaded terms such as \u2018sexual debut\u2019 or \u2018first sexual encounter\u2019. According to Healthline, this myth of virginity can impact the way we think about sex and our expectations for sex in the first place. The concept of virginity as we know it assumes that one is losing something when they have sex for the first time, putting a negative connotation on sex.\n\nMyth #5: The words vulva and vagina are interchangeableThis is something a lot of people misunderstand, including people with vulvas. Planned Parenthood defines the vulva as the part of the genitals on the outside of the body of those who were assigned female at birth. The vagina, however, is a canal that connects one\u2019s vulva with their cervix and uterus. It\u2019s the portal to which babies and menstrual blood leave the body. Vaginas are one part of the vulva, which is the larger structure.\n\nSource: Planned Parenthood\n\nMyth #6: People with disabilities and chronic illnesses cannot have sexPeople with disabilities and chronic illnesses are sexual beings. The myth that they cannot have sex or are not sexual largely stems from ableism. Our Bodies, Ourselves, an organization that empowers women with information about health, sexuality and reproduction, debunks this myth that those with chronic illness and disabilities are uninterested in sex, unable to have sex, or are undesirable. In fact, they indicate that some women with chronic illness, such as fibromyalgia, find that direct genital stimulation can help block the pain that they are feeling. They also note that medical establishments need to recognize that people with chronic illness and disabilities want to be seen as sexual beings. A study published in American Family Physician specifies that this assumption can be harmful to those with disabilities and chronic illnesses, as it can cause them to become uninterested in sex because of misconceptions about their ability to have sex, as well as other factors, such as depression, fatigue, pain and stress.\n\nMyth #7: Sex ends with ejaculationAbsolutely not! Sexual interactions are about the pleasure of all parties involved. It is important to communicate with your partner(s) about when you are ready for sex to be over. Partnered sex is about communal pleasure. Unless you are engaging in a specific BDSM scene where one person\u2019s pleasure is prioritized over another, such as in a M/S dynamic, and it has been decided beforehand, everyone\u2019s pleasure should be prioritized.\u00a0\u00a0Pleasure is the cornerstone of sexual wellbeing. Ejaculation is not. All bodies are different and not all bodies will always ejaculate during sex. Everyone\u2019s pleasure is important!\n\nMyth #8: The pullout method is an effective way to prevent pregnancyThis myth is one that affects people who are engaging in penile-vaginal intercourse, which is not reflective of all sexual interactions. The pullout method is a method of birth control where the partner with a penis removes their penis from the vagina before ejaculation occurs. Some may believe that the pullout method is a reliable and effective method of birth control, when in fact it is not. According to Planned Parenthood, the pullout method, also known as withdrawal, is only 78% effective when used alone. Furthermore, the pullout method does not work to protect against STIs. Barrier methods such as internal and external condoms and dental dams are safer methods that can effectively prevent pregnancy and the transmission of STIs and HIV.\n\nMyth #9: Kink is shamefulKink is not shameful. It is actually extremely common. An article published in Haworth Press reveals that up to 14% of American men and 11% of American women report having engaged in some form of BDSM. The Kink Clinical Practice Guidelines also state that approximately 45-60% of the population experience fantasies related to dominance and/or submission. By understanding how common kink is, we can begin to break down the stigma surrounding kink and those that practice it.\u00a0Kink is also not a monolith. When shaming the world of kink, many are shaming a concept, rather than an act. There are multiple ways to engage in kink, such as bondage, dominance, masochism, submission, and role play, and none of them are shameful. Give this Glamour article a read to learn more about kinks and fetishes in A to Z format.Research published in the Journal of Sex Medicine suggests that people who practice kink have a desire to engage in discussions with their health care providers about their health without fear of being judged for their sexual desires. The more that kink is societally stigmatized, the more harmful it can be to those engaging in kink.TLDR: Kink is not shameful and Kinksters should not be stigmatized. A kink is simply a form of sexual desire or behavior.\n\nWhile these are not the only myths and misconceptions about sex, these are some of the common ones we have heard frequently. It is always good to do your research before believing something new about sex, or anything for that matter. There is so much false information, and we are here to help. Some things you can do when encountering new information about sex include: consider the source of the information, research the information yourself and look for empirical evidence that supports or disproves it, and talk with professionals about why said information is fact versus opinion.Remember, sexuality education is a lifelong journey.

Love, Millennials\n\n\n\nAs a psychotherapist working with individuals and couples across the lifespan, I often notice situations where people are in distress due to a conflict caused by generational influence. Lately, I\u00a0have come to notice an association between stress amongst the millennial generation as it relates to generational attitudes. Millennials, individuals born between the years 1977-1995 (a.k.a. Generation Y), report experiencing significant pressure about how to speed up their lives, in particular in their relationships. When exploring the source of such pressure, parents and familial influence\u00a0were identified as strong influences. Parents of millennials are likely to be a part of the baby boomer generation, individuals born between the years of 1946-1964. As every generation brings with them their experiences of critical events in history, they also have their own contemporary attitudes. It is not uncommon for parents to use their perspectives to teach their children how to navigate life\u2019s challenges. Whether these challenges include acquiring jobs, commitment in relationships, significant purchases, building a family, etc., parents\u2019 teachings are inherently based upon their own experiences and attitudes. This can become particularly challenging when there is a discrepancy between parents and their (adult) children. One millennial shares their understanding of the difference between generations\u2026\u201cI think millennials feel the most pressure. It (the future) is on us because we want change. We stray from the boomer mindset of one for ourselves and think more openly about the collective. We\u2019ve learned from the boomers, who really lead the way!\u201dTasha, 30Some believe their parents have good intentions yet separate motivations for building success\u2026\u201cI think boomer parents try to pressure millennial children into the boxes they put themselves in to succeed\u2026like the idea that you have to work for a corporation. Boomers saw jobs as security for their families whereas millennials don\u2019t see money as the be-all end-all. We care about what we work for and want fulfillment in our daily jobs. The hardest part of our generation is the balance between security and personal fulfillment.\u201dSarah, 30\n\nOthers share that they feel pressured to take their parents\u2019 preference into account in making major decisions\u2026\u201cWe all want our parent\u2019s approval, especially when it comes to the people we date. I think that family and other adults have put on pressure on me to date within the religion I was brought up in. Also, being someone in a relationship for over 3 years now, a lot of adults start to ask about engagements, marriage and kids just because it seems like a logical next step. I want to get my feet off the ground, I want to travel, gain a little life experience before settling down. It\u2019s a different generation; the baby boomers were all married with kids before 30, I just don\u2019t see the millennial generation going in that same trend. I think it\u2019s important that you really know yourself and are truly ready before you commit to marriage or children.\u201dDanielle, 22Another shares that they accept their parents\u2019 attitudes are different than their own and have a mutual understanding of approaching life differently\u2026\u201cMy parents try to influence my dating decisions but it doesn't necessarily work. I understand that they're from a different time. They got engaged in college, married at 23 and had two kids by my age. They don't really understand our generation\u2019s trepidation for marrying early, and that's okay. Would they prefer I settled down earlier? Of course. Are they happy I've taken my time to find the right person to eventually settle down with? Absolutely.\u201dThomas, 28How do you believe generational patterns influence you?

These are all terms used to reference oral sex which is any activity that involves the mouth, lips, or tongue, to stimulate the genitals, or anus of a sex partner. According to the CDC, more than 85% of sexually-active adults (ages 18 to 44) reported having oral sex at least once with a partner, showing just how common oral sex is.\u00a0The safest situation, other than abstaining from oral sex, is to only have oral sex if you are in a sexually monogamous relationship and you and your partner have both been tested recently. Not everyone is in this situation, and that should not deter you from having oral sex.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oral sex can be extremely pleasurable, but it is important to take precautions since STI (Sexually Transmitted Infection) transmission can occur. Here are some critical things to know when engaging in oral sex.\u00a01. A person can acquire an STI while participating in oral sexAccording to the CDC, certain infections such as Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Herpes, HPV, and in rare occasions, HIV, can be transmitted during oral sex. Furthermore, according to Avert, a charity providing accurate and trusted information about HIV and sexual health, notes that if you are engaging in oral-anal sex you could contract infections such as hepatitis A and E.coli. There is generally a very low risk of HIV infection from oral sex unless the receptive partner is living with an STI and has genital sores, or the partner providing oral stimulation has an STI and is symptomatic with sores, warts, or bleeding gums.\u00a0\u00a0Not all STIs have symptoms and/or symptoms could be more subtle. The University of Florida's Student Health Care Center recommends \u201clooking before you lick,\u201d to check for lesions, growths, or unusual discharge in the genital area. If you notice any of these, hold off on oral sex until your partner gets tested since these symptoms may be due to STIs. Furthermore, according to Avert, infections can be passed on even if there are no obvious signs or symptoms, meaning you should be getting tested frequently.\u00a0If you are sexually active, the best practice is to get tested for STIs frequently. The CDC provides extensive guidelines for how often you should get tested based on your demographic, but it is advisable to get tested with each new partner for full transparency. Furthermore, many are unaware of window periods, the time it takes for an STI to read as positive after it has been transmitted. While some STIs only take a week to show up on a test, some may take up to four months.It is always important to discuss your safer sex plans with your partner(s) including your test history and results, any sexual health concerns you are currently experiencing, and how this information will inform your plans for practicing safer [oral] sex. Greatist provides a helpful template on how you can speak to new partners about your sexual health status.\u00a0To learn more about STIs and how to talk about them head over to our\u00a0 recent blog post, Discussing Your STI Status and Practicing Safer Sex.\u00a02.\u00a0 Use barrier methods for protection\u00a0A way to protect against STIs during oral sex is by using barrier methods such as condoms and dental dams. There are a variety of brands, styles, and flavors of barrier methods to choose from, which can be fun to mix it up. You and a sexual partner can get a variety of barrier methods and try out a new one every time you engage in oral sex! A good rule of thumb is to always have your barrier method of choice with you so that you can always engage in safer oral sex. Lastly, make sure to use a new barrier for each sex act.\u00a0External CondomsIf you are giving oral sex and your partner has a penis, we recommend using an external condom to prevent the transmission of STIs. To learn more about how to use external condoms, visit our Instagram for an IGTV demonstration led by ESW associate, Marnie Spiegel.Dental DamsIf your partner has a vulva, or you are stimulating your partner anally, we recommend using a dental dam. To use a dental dam, hold one side against your partner\u2019s vulva or anus and lick the other side, making sure to never turn the dam over. This graphic from Healthline shows how to use a dental dam.\n\nSource: Healthline\n\nExperts also recommend using a dental dam if the receptive partner is menstruating because menstrual blood can carry bacteria and viruses. Sometimes it can be difficult to find dental dams on short notice. Dental dams cannot always be found at gas stations, grocery stores, or doctors\u2019 offices, so Healthline recommends going to a local adult store that sells pleasure devices, lube, and condoms or ordering them online at stores such as World Condoms or Undercover Condoms. There\u2019s no need to worry because you can make your own by cutting a condom lengthways from bottom to top/the tip to create a single piece of material that can be used as a dam. This graphic from Healthline illustrates how you can create a dental dam out of a condom.\n\nSource: Healthline\n\nWatch this video from University of Chicago\u2019s wellness center that teaches you how to convert an external condom into an effective dental dam!\n\nFinger CondomsFinger cots, or more commonly known as finger condoms, can be used when fingering a vagina or anus. Elizabeth Boskey at Very Well Health states that finger condoms can be an effective barrier method if you are only using one finger. They can reduce the risk of certain STIS and are often more comfortable than gloves. They note that finger condoms can be found in some first aid aisles of drugstores, but you can also purchase them online or make them by cutting a finger off of a latex glove. You can also experiment with different flavors of barrier methods, to excite your tastebuds and make safer oral sex more enjoyable - we recommend the strawberry flavor.3. Brushing your teeth or using mouthwash before and after engaging in oral sex can lead to infectionYou may want your breath to smell good before \u201cgoing down\u201d on someone, but brushing your teeth can actually increase your risk of contracting an STI. According to the University of Georgia\u2019s Health Center, flossing and brushing your teeth can cause your gums to bleed, thus irritating them and making it easier for an infection to pass from one partner to another. In a 2017 interview with Shape magazine, endodontist Gary Glassman, D.D.S shared that you should only be rinsing your mouth out with water, nothing else, before and after having oral sex.Oral hygiene is a necessary part of having safer oral sex. According to the CDC, poor oral health can lead to tooth decay, gum disease, bleeding gums, and oral cancer, thus making it easier for STIs to be transmitted. Make sure you are brushing and flossing regularly!4. If you think you have the common cold, hold off on oral sex, as you may have an oral infectionIt is important to note that some oral infections can be easily confused with the common cold. Assistant professor of clinical medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Gil Weiss, M.D, reports that some symptoms of STIs (such as a sore throat, cough, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck) are similar to symptoms of a common cold. The University of Georgia\u2019s Health Center recommends abstaining from oral sex if your partner has a cold sore on their mouth or they are living with sores, discharge, or unusual odors on their genitals as these may be signs of infection.Oral sex is pleasurable, but can be made even more pleasurable if sexual safety is taken into account. If you are feeling nervous about having oral sex because you think you may be experiencing symptoms of an STI, we recommend you hold off on oral sex until you get tested. Keep these tips in mind as you engage in oral sex, but most importantly make sure you are having a pleasureful time!\u00a0TLDR:A person can acquire an STI while participating in oral sexUse barrier methods for protection\u00a0Brushing your teeth or using mouthwash before and after engaging in oral sex can lead to infectionIf you think you have the common cold, hold off on oral sex, as you may have an oral infection<|endoftext|>"}

You are not alone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is called arousal non-concordance and it is a common phenomenon, particularly among women. When we use the term \u2018women\u2019, we will be referring to people with vulvas because that is most consistent with the research; however, we know that arousal non-concordance affects people of all genders, including transgender, genderqueer, and non-binary folks, as well as intersex people. Emily Nagoski speaks about arousal non-concordance in her book Come As You Are, where she finds that there is about a 10 percent overlap between how women are responding to a situation and what stimuli they feel subjectively aroused by. This means that when a woman experiences lubrication, it does not automatically mean that they are aroused. For men however, Nagoski finds that there is a 50 percent overlap between genital response and subjective sexual arousal.\n\nPhoto Credit: Emily Nagoski via Medium. Retrieved from: https://medium.com/@enagoski/unwanted-arousal-it-happens-29679a156b92\n\nTypes of ArousalTo begin we must differentiate between different types of arousal. According to the American Psychological Association, arousal is a state of excitement or energy expenditure linked to an emotion. Physiological arousal is arousal that is shown by physiological responses, such as increased blood flow to the genital area and increased heart rate. According to the International Society for Sexual Medicine, subjective sexual arousal is the active mental engagement in sex. It is important to differentiate these types of arousal when exploring arousal non-concordance. When physiological and subjective sexual arousal are not the same, arousal non-concordance occurs.\u00a0So Why Am I Wet?Wetness can be caused by a variety of factors. Genital lubrication is a natural part of your physiological functioning. Healthline explains that genital lubrication is essential to protect from injury or tearing. Furthermore, lubrication is a self-cleaning mechanism that keeps you or your partner\u2019s vulva clean, moist, and free from infection.\u00a0You can also become wet from touch even if you do not find it arousing. Bellesa shares that some women experience wetness during pelvic exams or even sexual assault. These situations can be uncomfortable, but they are simply a physiological reaction to touch rather than an indicator of sexual arousal.\u00a0Becoming wet during uncomfortable experiences can be a sign that stimuli are sexually relevant, yet not appealing at all. Emily Nagoski, notes that some people get wet even when stimuli are \u201cdisgusting or appalling or horrifying.\u201d This just means that the sexually relevant signals in your brain are being cued. A genital response is not desire or pleasure, it is simply sexually relevant.\n\nConsent Is KeyConsent is always important and knowing that wetness does not equal arousal makes consent even more critical. You should always listen to your partner when they share what they are excited about and pay close attention to their words rather than rely on a response from their genitals. Make sure that you and your partners are only participating activities that you are comfortable with and have agreed upon. You can create healthy dialogue to figure out your needs and wants during any sexual interaction.Remember that wetness or an erection does not mean the person is consenting, it could mean many things and you should never assume it means consent. Amy Frier, a sex therapist, explains this more in depth for men, if you want to learn more.\u00a0It is important to note that this concept pertains to survivors of sexual assault as well. According to a rape crisis center\n\nin England, survivors of sexual assault are often told that they are not \u201ctrue victims\u201d because in cases where they produced a sexual physiological response, such as becoming wet during the assault.\u00a0 Knowing that vaginal lubrication does not mean a person is aroused completely destroys this argument and should be noted in the future when issues of sexual assault are talked about.\u00a0Aroused But Can\u2019t Get Wet? Here Are Some Things You Can DoUse Lube!Remember the Clitoris\u00a0Masturbate - You know your body best and can learn what stimulation you enjoy from solo sex.\u00a0More Than SexArousal non-concordance does not only have to do with genitals. Nagoski explains that when faced with an emotionally intense scenario, you are experiencing a physiological response and your reaction primarily has to do with the emotion of the stimuli, not the exact stimuli itself. Nagoski discussed this in her Ted Talk by sharing, \u201cArousal non-concordance happens with every emotional and motivational system we have. If my mouth waters when I bite into a wormy apple, does anybody say to me, you said no, but your body said yes?\u201d Through this, she is allowing the listener to understand that non-concordance happens in all aspects of our physiological lives and is completely normal.\n\nA 2012 study suggests that while men experience more concordance in sexual behaviors than women do, this does not translate to all physiological states. Simply speaking, the difference in sexual concordance does not translate to a difference with non-sexual arousal concordance, we all experience arousal non-concordance on similar levels.\u00a0At the end of the day the important thing to remember is this: genital wetness does not automatically mean that you or your partners are aroused, it just means you are being exposed to sexually relevant stimuli.<|endoftext|>"}

While psychotherapy can look differently depending on the clinician and the presenting concerns, I'm hopeful that this information will be useful to you as you consider embarking on the therapeutic process.\u00a0I'm here to share with you some tips as to when therapy might be the right choice for you and\u00a0what to expect before, during and after an initial session. So, when is the right time to seek out a therapist?Today, Tomorrow, or whenever YOU believe it is the right time for you. I like to think about the role of a therapist as similar to a coach or teacher. We are here to help provide direction, empathy, and honest reflection at times, but ultimately you are the leader of your own life. You choose what skills you want to work on and concerns you want to address and we can help you sort through the messiness, unpack it and make sense of it. We can\u00a0coach you through the difficult moments and celebrate the successful ones.Similarly to a teacher or a coach, we do not do all the work for you. Instead, we provide support and guidance\u00a0while you put in the effort to changing\u00a0whichever aspect of your life it\u00a0is that you wish to change.If you are wondering whether or not it is the right time for you to begin therapy, I encourage you to consider the following questions:Are you feeling stuck or experiencing distress? Are your\u00a0concerns impacting you in negative ways that no longer feel manageable? Do your struggles interfere with your ability to live your everyday life? Are you ready to make a commitment to mental health and wellness by changing whatever it is in your life that is not working for you?If you answered yes to any of\u00a0the questions above, therapy sounds like it could be helpful.You may not know what is going on. You may just realize that you're not feeling like yourself or something seems off lately. You may not have a clue how to get there (and by there I mean feeling better). That's okay. You may feel as stuck as being knee deep in quicksand. But, you know you want a change in your life\u00a0and you're ready to accept the responsibility of getting yourself there.So,\u00a0you've decided that you want to give therapy a try, now what? Maybe you type therapist into Google and then a bunch of names pop up and you are suddenly feeling quite overwhelmed. One way to narrow your search is to think about what you are looking for from a therapist.What are the\u00a0concerns that you want to address in therapy?Many therapists are familiar treating anxiety and depression, but sometimes the presenting concerns are more complex and someone with more training would be a better fit given the nature of the concern. For example,\u00a0my training is\u00a0in marriage and family therapy with an emphasis on sexuality. A client who struggles with intimacy or reports low sexual desire in their marital relationship may\u00a0seek me out because of my clinical training in those areas.If you are unsure, maybe grab a pen and paper and try writing down what\u00a0has felt different or concerning to you lately that you would like to address\u00a0in therapy.\u00a0These ideas can be buzzwords to help you connect with a therapist who has experience or extensive training in treating those concerns.Other\u00a0things to consider...Location, Availability & Payment OptionsDo\u00a0you want to see someone closer to work or home or somewhere in between?Do you need to see someone at a specific time such as during your lunch break? Usually evenings and weekends are high-priority times for therapists, so you may want to keep that in mind as you begin your search.Are you looking to see a therapist that is in network with a particular insurance provider or are you going to be paying out of pocket?Once you have some more details, you will be better prepared to connect with a therapist to fit your needs. Perhaps you'll utilize a search engine like Psychology Today\u00a0which allows you to locate a professional near you by selecting different filters based on specific criteria such issues (ADHD, addiction, anxiety, depression, etc.), location (zip codes), age (children, adults, teenagers), treatment orientation (Cognitive-Behavioral or CBT, Structural, Dialectical-Behavioral or DBT, etc.), insurance provider (self-pay, Medicaid, BCBS, etc.), faith, language, or sexuality.Another way to connect with a therapist is\u00a0through a referral from someone you know. Maybe the referral comes from a friend or family member or maybe another clinician. Doctors and other health professionals often have lists of clinicians that they refer to which can be helpful if there's a doctor you trust that you can speak to about looking for a referral.Connecting With A TherapistOnce you have narrowed your search and have some names of clinicians and their contact information, you are ready to reach out.When you first contact a therapist, you might indicate that you are looking to set up a time for you two to talk about whether working together will be a good fit. During this time you can ask all the questions you have about how they practice, find out if they are a good match for you in terms of availability, you can discuss the payment process and any other concerns you have. You may decide to go ahead and schedule a session with them at this time or you may want to think about it and let them know. The choice is yours.PaperworkPrior to the session, the therapist may opt to send you some paperwork to\u00a0sign that includes\u00a0their privacy practices and consent for psychotherapy treatment. Some therapists choose to review\u00a0these documents with you at the beginning of the first session. These documents will cover their legal and ethical duties in regards to confidentiality, your protected health information\u00a0and privacy. They also cover the policies implemented by the practice, clinic or agency where the therapist works. It is important to read these carefully and mark any questions you have so that you can ask the therapist if you would like more clarification on something. Treat these documents like any legal document that you would sign.The Initial SessionThe first time you do anything, it's normal to be a little nervous. You're not sure what will it will be like. Many first sessions are about therapists leaning in to understand what lead the\u00a0client into their office. This is an opportunity for clients to share with therapists what's going on that seems concerning, challenging, bothersome or unusual that ultimately lead them to choose therapy. The goal of this session for you, the client, is to see if this therapist is a good fit for you and your needs.Do you feel comfortable addressing your concerns with this person and\u00a0developing a trusting relationship with them? I encourage you to listen to your intuition or your gut on this one. If it feels like a good fit, you'll know. If it does not feel like a good fit, I encourage you to think about what it was that left you feeling that way. These can\u00a0be helpful cues to pay attention to as you continue looking for a better fit.At the end of the first session, the therapist may ask you if you are interested in scheduling another session (not all therapists phrase it this way). This is a good time to let the therapist know if 1) you would like to continue 2) you would not like to continue or 3) you are unsure and you would like to think about whether or not you would like to continue. It is not a big deal if you choose to think about it or even if you tell a therapist directly that you do not think it's a good fit. Remember, this is your therapy- so you get to choose who is a good fit for you.Therapy...Continued.Congrats, you made it past the first session. Hopefully\u00a0that was not as scary or terrible as you had anticipated. Maybe you are even feeling a sense of hope. What are you feeling right now? It might be useful to do some reflecting on what this experience (the first therapy session) was like for you. This way, you can refer back to those feelings in the future when you evaluate your progress.So now, you have\u00a0the chance to either schedule another session with the therapist you met with OR you can reach out to a different clinician that seems like a better fit and schedule an initial session. Usually therapists will talk about their therapeutic process, how they communicate with you around scheduling, payment, etc. when you first meet. If they missed something, feel free to bring it up and ask them. Therapists forget things sometimes - they are human too.I hope I was able to shed some light on the process of therapy for you and I hope you feel more prepared\u00a0going forward.\u00a0I wish you the best on your therapeutic journey - may it be filled with great insight and profound learning opportunities.If you have any other questions about beginning therapy, I encourage you to share your questions below or reach out to me via email. As always, I appreciate your feedback<|endoftext|>"}

Societal conditioning has taught non-men in particular that setting boundaries or denying someone\u2019s request is a faux pas. Communicating boundaries allows for healthy relationships though and it is integral to the health of oneself and one\u2019s relationships to be able to do so.\u00a0\tCommunication is a cornerstone of all healthy relationships. Being open and honest about one's feelings helps to prevent building resentment, allows us to work through conflict, and have our needs met. Like any other skill, communication is a muscle that needs to be exercised and will get easier over time as you practice it over and over again. One of the biggest obstacles to setting boundaries can be the instinct to please people, prompting a concern that setting boundaries will offend someone. You cannot be responsible for other people\u2019s emotions so while you should absolutely aim to communicate effectively and kindly, after that their reaction is out of your hands. It\u2019s natural that when you set a new boundary, the other person may feel upset which is understandable because people can\u2019t really control how they feel. What they can, and should control, is their ensuing behavior. Their actions will be telling of their respect for your boundaries; if they push back, refuse to accept it, or do not align their behavior in accordance with the boundary, that is a red flag. Truly supportive people who are invested in your wellbeing will be grateful for the guidance and respect your needs.\n\nWith the \u201cwhy\u201d established, it\u2019s time to talk about the \u201cwhat.\u201d The initial step is to get in touch with your own needs to figure out what your boundaries should be. Generally speaking, the types of boundaries are physical, time, conversational, content, emotional, material, and sexual. Here are examples of each:Physical: Asking not to be huggedTime: Setting time ranges where you will or will not be available to be contactedConversational: Not engaging in conversation about politics with people you are unfamiliar withContent: Not consuming content regarding triggering topics i.e. mental illnessEmotional: Telling a friend who needs emotional support that you do not have the emotional space to support them at the momentMaterial: Not allowing your phone to be accessed without your express permissionSexual: Using protection whenever you have sex\u00a0The exact boundaries that you may set do not have to match the ones above, rather the examples are meant to give you an idea of what boundaries might look like. The \u201cright\u201d boundaries to set are the ones that make you feel healthy, safe, respected, and comfortable. Here are some guiding questions to help you figure out what boundaries you may want to set:How do you want to be touched and by whom? How do you want your family to physically interact with you, if at all? What about friends? Coworkers?How can you structure your time so you can attend to your responsibilities and also fulfill your own needs? How much alone time do you need, if any? How much time do you want to invest in sectors of your life like work, friendships, romance, etc.?\u00a0Are there any topics that make you feel uncomfortable to discuss and what are they? How does that comfort vary based on who you are with? Do you need to set different conversational boundaries for different relationships? Do you have any triggering topics you may want to set boundaries around?Do your social media feeds make you feel good? If not, what could be eliminated or added to change that? How do you consume news, and do you find that your consumption of it is more effective than it is draining? What role does media consumption play in your life? Is there any way it could be improved? How does consuming the media in your life at present make you feel?What activities/interactions boost your emotional energy? What drains it? Do you know how to tell when you cannot take on any more emotional weight?Which possessions would you prefer to keep private? Who is allowed to access those possessions, if anyone other than yourself? Are there certain times you would allow access to those possessions? What does that look like?\u00a0What makes you feel safe or unsafe during sex? What conditions will make you the most comfortable and at ease?\n\nOnce you figure out your \u201cwhat\u201d when it comes to boundaries, the \u201chow\u201d is the final step before expressing the boundaries. It can be scary to express boundaries but remember, it is a gift to the person you are interacting with when you set clear boundaries. If they make you feel like you are a burden, you may want to reconsider the relationship. Some effective communication tips include\u2026Validate the other person's point of view. Empathy goes a long way.Apologize less, only apologize when it's truly warranted. You don't need to apologize for bringing up an issue with someone, for example, because you have done nothing wrong by setting a boundary, even if they don\u2019t like it.\u00a0Avoid making assumptions about the other person's motives or thoughts. Definitely don't accuse someone based on those assumptions.Be respectful. Disagreeing with someone or being hurt by them are not justifications for yelling, insulting, or attacking.Speak from the \"I\" perspectiveEx: Instead of \"you don't pay attention to my needs,\" try \"I feel upset that my needs aren't being met. Can we talk about how to work on that together?\"If what you have to say is unpleasant, don't sugarcoat. Be upfront and honest without trying to be \"nice;\" it's a crutch and it helps no one. You are responsible for your feelings and for expressing them appropriately but you are not responsible for the other person\u2019s feelings.\u00a0LISTEN! This seems obvious but so often, we listen to respond as opposed to listening to understand. Without understanding the other person, your communication will fall flat.Hopefully all of this information will set you up for success while setting boundaries in your relationships. If you still find yourself needing more help, there are more resources out there to assist you. Positive Psychology has a great guide to creating boundaries including some worksheets to help encourage self-reflection around it. Mind Body Green offers elaboration on the types of boundaries and examples of each. Finally, Love is Respect is both a great general resource for healthy relationship tips and they also have a specific guide to setting boundaries.<|endoftext|>"}

There is a wide variety of types of birth control and different options suit different lifestyles best. For example, for people who want to prevent pregnancy with a low maintenance option, an implant or IUD may be a good option. Embrace Sexual Wellness has compiled an overview of contraceptive options, with information such as efficacy, pros and cons, side effects, and more. We hope this guide will aid you in figuring out which method will work best for you. Keep in mind that condoms and dental dams are the only form of contraceptive that protects against STIs and should be paired with another method to ensure the most effective protection against pregnancy and STIs. We recommend using at least two methods, one of which should protect against STIs, to ensure the maximum amount of protection.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Note: all efficacy rates refer to perfect usage of the method and with those that require manual maintenance, human error may diminish efficacy ratesIntrauterine Devices (IUDs)\n\nOverviewEfficacy: 99% effectiveSTI Protection: Does not protect against STIsHow it\u2019s used: inserted by a doctor.

Most of that is made up of misconceptions though, which is why we\u2019re here to clear them up. The reality is that condoms are an invaluable tool for safer sex. They are currently the only barrier method to effectively prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). You may be thinking \u201cbut I don\u2019t have any STIs!\u201d but in actuality, you can have asymptomatic, yet still transmittable STIs. The only way to ensure you do not have an STI is to get tested regularly. Condoms help prevent the transmission of STIs. It should be noted, there is no shame around STIs; they\u2019re natural and they happen. That being said, most people would prefer to avoid them!\u00a0Types of Condoms\tWhen you think of a condom, you probably think about a latex sheath that rolls over any phallic object, be that penis or otherwise. Within this category of external condoms, there are a variety of options that differ in effects and material. There are also internal condoms. Here are a few of the most common types of condoms.\u00a0External\u00a0This is the condom you know and (maybe?) love. They are widely available, affordable, and 98% effective when used correctly.\u00a0Internal\u00a0Internal condoms, much less popular than their inverted sibling, are essentially a pouch that's inserted in the vagina or anus. It works like other condoms, except that it's worn on the inside.Spermicide-coatedThere are traditional condoms that are sold with a sperm-killing chemical on them. It is debatable whether the amount is significant enough to make a difference. The best bet, if you are interested in spermicide, would be to use a separate spermicide product in conjunction with condoms.PolyurethanePolyurethane condoms are an option for anyone who has a latex allergy. The biggest downside is that these are slightly more prone to breakage which is not a great quality for a condom. This means it is even more important than usual to have an additional contraceptive method on board with these types of condoms. An upside of these condoms is that polyurethane tends to be thinner than latex and may offer a preferable sensation for the person wearing them.FlavoredFlavored condoms are exactly what they sound like: regular condoms that have flavors. These are best for oral sex, as opposed to vaginal or anal intercourse. As an aside, yes, you should be using condoms even for oral sex. The flavor has the potential to enhance the experience for the giver of oral sex but they should not be used inside any orifice of the body (e.g., vagina or anus) because the ingredients that create the flavor might cause irritation if used internally.TexturedTextured condoms are also exactly what they sound like: regular condoms but with texture. While the texture offers no protective benefit, it may provide additional pleasure for the recipient of intercourse. It can be fun to experiment with different textures and evaluate how they impact the sexual experience.\u00a0TipsAlways make sure your condom fits snugly but not so tightly it might break. Size is a huge factor in condom efficacy.\u00a0Do not reuse condoms.\u00a0Condoms expire! Regularly check their expiration date to make sure yours are still good to go; if not, they are far more likely to break.\u00a0If your condom is not already lubricated, apply lube to the body before insertion to decrease friction (high friction leads to breakage).Do not keep a condom in your wallet. The heat and friction are a recipe for breakage.\u00a0Find a condom that you enjoy the feeling of, or at the very least do not mind. This way, you\u2019ll be far more likely to use them.\u00a0Do not use condoms with oil-based lubricant or any other oil-based product like baby oil or Vaseline. They will cause the condom to deteriorate.\u00a0Do not wear more than one condom. It\u2019s unnecessary at best and can lead to breakage at worst.\u00a0For marathon sessions or longer sexual encounters, switch out condoms about every 30 minutes to prevent breakage.\u00a0Happy National Condom Month! Now that you are aware of condom best practices,\n\nyou can enjoy yourself while practicing safer sex with peace of mind.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "embracesexualwellness", "text": "<|endoftext|>Conquering Conflict @ Your Boiling Point\n\n\n\nWe all have limits, metaphorical boiling points if you will. You surely remember, those moments when in any relationship your friend or partner is continually toying with lighting a match and turning on the burner underneath you. Maybe it shows up as your friend will not back off from challenging your political ideas\u00a0or your availability to attend their bachelor party the same weekend as an important event scheduled at work. Perhaps it shows up as your partner reminds you to put the dishes away, pick up your laundry from the floor or pay bills after you have had a trying day at the office.Such moments are often described as frustrating or intense and can contribute to overall stress. Let's say your base layer of stress is already at a 7 out of 10, it doesn't take much for someone\u00a0to\u00a0turn up the heat another notch. What happens next?In my experience clinically, the most common reactions I see are a combination of something in between these scenarios:The feeling many people describe as \"I just cannot take it anymore!\" comes over and then you explode at your partner, yelling at them and perhaps saying things you do not mean that are hurtful. This fighting continues and creates tension which then becomes distance between you both.The presence of negative self-talk \"I can't do anything right\" emerges as we draw away from the relationship and blame ourselves, internally sulking and de-sensationalizing. This type of conflict might appear as one or both people become reclusive or initiate the silent treatment.So\u00a0maybe you identify your own pattern of dealing with conflict, however similar or different from these examples. Now return to your boiling point, remember what that felt like. What's happening within you right now?Neurologically, here's what is actually happening in your brain and why it might be hard to communicate clearly...There are two areas in our brain that are centrally activated during our interactions of\u00a0conflict - the limbic area or emotional brain, which includes the amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Within the limbic system, our amygdala appears petite,\u00a0yet it can have a powerful impact as it is responsible for responding to fear and rage. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) orchestrates thoughtful decision-making abilities and is our source of reasoning and good judgement.When we are in the midst of an argument with a partner or friend, perhaps fearful of what may come of the interaction or we become angered by the threat of feeling attacked, our amygdala reacts and takes charge. Simply\u00a0put, our emotional brain takes over making it very difficult for us to communicate clearly to our partners and friends. This makes sense because thoughtfulness in this moment\u00a0would require sufficient PFC functioning.\u00a0Mona Fishbane, PhD., clinical psychologist and family therapist, describes this limbic area activation as \"the low road\" of reactivity and the PFC activation as \"the high road\" of thoughtfulness in her application of neuroscience to her psychotherapy work and in her book, Loving With The Brain in Mind, which is an excellent resource for couples.So, in order for us to decrease reactivity and increase thoughtfulness during moments of conflict,\u00a0the PFC must\u00a0communicate with the amygdala to calm it down (the brain is wired for this process to occur). We can activate this process in our PFC by engaging in calming behaviors - think diaphragmatic/deep breathing, meditation, a short walk, time to recollect, reflection, releasing tears, calming thoughts.When we engage in calming behaviors during intense moments where our emotional brain\u00a0has taken over and our PFC has gone off-line, we can actually open the pathway of communication between our PFC and amygdala, bringing our PFC back online. While these processes take time to learn and integrate into our daily lives, they are effective with the right amount of coaching and support. Perhaps you may find\u00a0psychotherapy to be a useful outlet.The Power of ChoiceNow, return to that boiling point one last time. Your blood is feeling as if it is boiling, you're annoyed and you can feel the heat. Maybe you're on the edge of conflict and it's uncomfortable for you or maybe you are cycling\u00a0your way through it, but here is some\u00a0good news.\u00a0You\u00a0have the opportunity to choose what you want to do in this moment and how you want to react. What\u00a0route will you take?<|endoftext|>"}

A Guide on How to Open Your Relationship\n\n\n\nCompulsory monogamy is the expectation that many, if not all, of us have grown up around. There is very little discussion about or representation of alternate romantic relationship structures. In the past few years, polyamory has become a little less foreign to the general public; however, that doesn\u2019t mean that most people know how to practice ethical non-monogamy, also known as consensual non-monogamy or polyamory. With that in mind, this is a non-comprehensive guide on how to get started with opening up a relationship.Some Key TermsBefore talking about the how, we need to talk about the what.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compersion: A feeling of joy when a partner invests in and takes pleasure from another romantic or sexual relationship.Metamour: The partner of one\u2019s partner, with whom one does not share a direct sexual or loving relationshipPrimary/nesting partner: In a hierarchical ENM relationship, the person (or persons) in the relationship with the highest degree of involvement or entanglement, or sometimes the person accorded the most importance.Polyamory/ethical (or consensual) non-monogamy: when someone is in romantic or sexual relationships with multiple people at once. Does not necessitate marriage, like polygamy does.Polygamy: more of a legal term, this refers to the practice of specifically marrying more than one person. Often religiously affiliated. Not interchangeable with polyamory.Open: at least one person in a committed relationship is open to sex with other people; does not involve a romantic aspect. \"Open\" has evolved to become used as an umbrella term for all non-monogamy.Swinging: when couples exchange partners.Monogamish: when a couple is mostly monogamous with occasional extracurricular experiences.Relationship anarchy: relationship anarchists believe in judging the value of relationships on a case by case basis, independent of sexual relationships, as opposed to how society tends to value sexual relationships over platonic relationships.\tThis is by no means an exhaustive list of all polyamory-adjacent terms but it\u2019s a good start. An important distinction as well is polyamorous vs. open relationships. The New York Times offers a wonderful explanation of the difference between open relationships and other forms of polyamory. In short though, polyamory (as in the relationship structure, not the self-identifier) means that multiple people are romantically and/or sexually involved at the same time. Open relationships are when at least one partner is free to explore outside the relationship and often function for solely sexual purposes as opposed to romantic. All open relationships are a form of polyamory, but not all polyamorous relationship are open, such as in the instance of a closed triad.\u00a0Why Isn\u2019t It Cheating?\u00a0\tAh, the million dollar question. One of the biggest stigmas that polyamorous people face is that they are overly promiscuous cheating scum. In actuality, healthy, ethical polyamorous relationships have similar standards to monogamy in that both require openness, honesty, and communication.\u00a0Cheating is non-consensual; it is a unilateral decision to break set boundaries in a relationship. Polyamory, when done right, is a deliberate consensual collaboration in which the boundaries set, while different from monogamous relationships, similarly cannot be crossed.\n\nNot to mention, cheating is possible in a polyamorous relationship; for example, if the people in the relationship agree that none of them can sleep with anyone that the people in the relationship know already, and then one of them sleeps with a friend, that is cheating.\u00a0We\u2019ve Got the What, Now for the HowResearch, research, and more research\tWhen you embark on the journey to open up a relationship, there is a lot to learn. Some questions you might seek answers to in your research are \u201cwhat is my own comfort level with x, y, z?\u201d \u201chow do I mitigate jealousy?\u201d \u201cwhat boundaries will make me feel safe?\u201d \u201cwhat needs to happen to ensure mutual trust?\u201d There are external resources at the bottom of the article.Opening your relationship is not a solutionIf your motivation for opening your relationship is to fix existing issues, stop. It will only serve to enlarge the wedge between you and your partner. Opening up a relationship should be a conscious desire and choice, not a bandaid.\u00a0Setting boundariesBefore opening up the relationship, you must set boundaries and expectations to avoid inadvertently hurting someone. Note that you should be agreeing on boundaries, not rules. An explanation of the distinction can be found here. Some boundaries to consider might include who you do/do not use barrier methods with during sexual encounters, how much you share with a partner about your exploits/metamours, whether you want to meet metamours, and how shared spaces will function.\u00a0The big green monster in the roomJealousy. This is what most people think of as their first objection to practicing polyamory. It will take work and patience to grapple with your jealousy, but it is definitely possible. An amazing resource for working through jealousy is The Jealousy Workbook by Kathy Labriola.\u00a0Communication nationThis is probably the most important tool in your relationship toolbox: COMMUNICATION. It is vital for any relationship, and that goes doubly for polyamory. While some people opt for a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy about what happens outside of the relationship, this is not recommended. It allows anxiety to fester until it turns to resentment. Generally speaking, the best practice for most people is to be completely transparent about what they\u2019re doing, with whom, for how long, practicing agreed upon boundaries.\u00a0\u00a0As was mentioned, this is not an exhaustive guide and you will need to seek out more information.

No graphic descriptions will be included, but it may nonetheless be upsetting or triggering to some readers. There are resources available at the end of the article for finding sexual assault survivor support.\n\nApril is Sexual Assault Awareness Month so we\u2019ll be covering different types of consent violations and how to handle them. Consent can be a tricky, nebulous topic and ultimately, there will be no \u201cone size fits all\u201d guide to handling consent violations because each circumstance is different. That being said, there are certainly general guidelines that are widely applicable, which is what this article will cover.\n\nConsent is a mutual agreement between involved parties to engage in a specified activity; for the purposes of this article, consent refers to sexual consent, but consent is relevant in all aspects of interpersonal interactions. Consent must be freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, and specific. A coerced \u201cyes\u201d does not count as consent and consent for one activity does not imply consent for other activities. Furthermore, consent is only valid when the involved parties are on the same page about what they are consenting to. There are endless ways to ascertain consent and while it may feel awkward at first, dealing with a little bit of awkwardness is far preferable to violating someone\u2019s boundaries. If you are unsure of how to go about establishing boundaries and consent, please refer to these resources:@givingthetalk, @comprehensiveconsent, @yestoconsent & @letstalkabtconsent on InstagramHow to Ask for ConsentThings That Are Not ConsentRevoking ConsentOngoing ConsentHow to Receive a \u201cNo\u201dWays to Give ConsentNational Sexual Violence Resource CenterTeen VogueConsent: It\u2019s Simple as TeaAbout Consent Podcast\tConsent violations can result from a variety of circumstances. Some people are unable to give consent, like minors, people with advanced intellectual disabilities, and non-sober people. In other instances, someone can give consent in theory but if consent is not attained in the ways discussed above, it cannot qualify as consent. A prime example of this is stealthing which refers to non-consensual condom removal. Regardless of whether or not the sex acts being performed were consensual, if that consent was given with the understanding that a condom would be used, failure to adhere to that invalidates the consent. When the terms of the consent have been changed without everyone involved being informed, it cannot qualify as consent.\tIt\u2019s difficult to advise a response to consent violation because every situation is unique. For consent violations that occur within a romantic relationship, you may want to repair it. If it\u2019s accessible to you, it\u2019s a great first step to seek professional help from a relationally trained psychotherapist. If this is inaccessible, here are some general tips:\u00a0\u00a0First and foremost, take care of yourself physically and emotionally. Do you need to be alone, do you need company, do you need to talk things through? Gauge your immediate needs and address them to whatever extent is accessible to you.\u00a0Though independent internal processing is absolutely beneficial, there is a fine line between that and isolating oneself which can stifle the healing process. If you\u2019re uncomfortable speaking to someone you know, consider calling a sexual assault crisis hotline (additional hotlines listed below).\u00a0If you are unfamiliar with your own boundaries and comfort levels with various sexual activities, do that work first so you will be able to give your partner(s) guidance to avoid something similar in the future. Should you struggle with this process, Embrace Sexual Wellness has another article about communication and boundaries here.\u00a0Scarleteen has an excellent worksheet for navigating your own trauma response which may be useful through this process as well.\u00a0It\u2019s nearly impossible to have a relationship without hurting each other at some point. The important part is how you move forward in a way that feels safe and comfortable for everyone involved.\u00a0It\u2019s valid if you feel like you cannot repair the relationship after a consent violation. Though it\u2019s easier said than done, prioritizing your needs, even if that means breaking things off, is the only way to ensure your healing process does not become stunted.\n\nWhile there are varying definitions of consent violations, the most important consideration is how you feel. Healthy, consensual sex should never leave any participants feeling uncomfortable or violated. If you are a survivor of a consent violation, resources like the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) and Planned Parenthood have thorough guides on how to proceed. If you have been accused of sexual assault, Teen Vogue has a guide for responding appropriately.Additional Hotlines\u00a0National Sexual Assault Hotline: 1\u2013800\u2013656\u20134673National Sexual Assault Chat: https://hotline.rainn.org/online/National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1\u2013800\u2013787\u20133224National Domestic Violence Chat: www.thehotline.org/helpRAINN Hotline: 800-656-4673 or Live Chat<|endoftext|>"}

However, during the time of coronavirus, practicing consent is more pressing than ever before. We are not only thinking of consent in terms of sexual interactions, but we are also now thinking of consent in terms of touching, hugging, distancing, etc. During this pandemic, we have recognized a greater need to respect others\u2019 boundaries. Now we have to decide if we are okay meeting a friend outdoors for a social distance hangout, giving someone a hug, giving someone an elbow bump, etc.\n\nWhat Is Consent?In its most basic definition, consent means to give one\u2019s approval. More broadly, it means to set boundaries of what you are okay with. When giving consent you are agreeing to an activity or letting another person know you are okay with something happening. If you do not wish to engage in an activity, you are saying no, which is revoking your consent. It\u2019s important to know your boundaries when entering into social interactions so you know what activities you are comfortable consenting to.\u00a0Here are some questions to allow you to understand your boundaries better:\u00a0Will you hug your friend, when you meet for coffee?Are you okay if a friend gives you a high five?How about an elbow bump?These are some examples of consent in a non-sexual context. Many look at consent in a largely sexual context, but the concept of consent applies to all aspects of life. Consent is typically taught through the acronym FRIES, meaning that consent is Freely given, Reversible, Informed, Enthusiastic, and Specific. This acronym clearly breaks down what consent is and gives a framework for conversations surrounding consent.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the meaning behind the FRIES acronym. Freely given means consenting is a choice you make without pressure, manipulation, or the influence of drugs and alcohol. Reversible means when you consent to something you are not consenting forever. Anyone can change their mind about what they are comfortable doing at any time. Informed means consent includes details. For example if you say \u2018yes\u2019 to having sex while using a condom, you are not consenting to having sex without a condom. Enthusiastic means that it is said enthusiastically and there is no doubt that you want or do not want to engage in an activity. Specific means saying yes to one thing, does not mean you are saying yes to another thing. For example, if you say yes to making out, that does not mean you are saying yes to having oral sex. While for some, it may seem like the natural progression of sexual relations, but that does not mean that everyone feels this way. Even if you think that someone agrees to being sexualwith you, asking for consent is still necessary.Why Is Consent Important During Covid?Since the beginning of the pandemic\u00a0 boundaries have likely changed. We are facing new challenges relating to interactions with others and even ourselves. Respecting personal boundaries is always important, but now it is critical. Mutual respect is arguably more important than ever. And productive communication is necessary.\u00a0Some of these boundaries may include not taking off masks in social interactions, not eating at a restaurant, not going inside of a store, etc. Practicing consent means respecting these boundaries and not making someone do something that makes them feel unsafe. Consent is critical to protect you, your friends and family, and your relationships with others.\u00a0\u00a0Be Honest and Have Open ConversationsAlways let those around you know when you are doing something that increases the risk of Covid. For example, if you are out with friends, instead of taking off your mask right away, ask if they are comfortable with you doing so. Ask if your friends are comfortable doing specific activities such as eating at a restaurant or having a picnic in the park, if they aren't, don't do it. It\u2019s that simple. It all comes down to respect.Don\u2019t just ask if people are comfortable with what you are doing. Be open to input! In these unprecedented times, we are all learning with and from each other. Don\u2019t just agree with your friends, but ask them why they are choosing not to do something.When you make a commitment to respect those around you you should also assure them that you will only do things that make them feel safe without any judgment or cold feelings.\n\nMake Sure Boundaries are ClearMake sure that there is no pressure when asking someone if they are comfortable doing something. Peer pressure has been shown to be highly influential in changing individuals\u2019 attitudes. When a person feels pressured by peers, they may make decisions because they feel they have to rather than because they want to. One way to reduce pressure is to let others know that any choice that they make is valid and you will respect that choice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Important Questions to AskYour friends are not mind readers and neither are you. That is why it is important to have constructive conversations in order to help your friends understand you better and vice versa. As you ask questions about the other\u2019s boundaries, think about how you would answer them yourself in order to think critically about your own boundaries.\u00a0Here are some questions to consider asking your friends:Are you comfortable with hugs right now?How would you feel if I took off my mask while we walk?Do you feel safe doing _______ (insert activity here)?Which activities are you comfortable with right now?\u00a0Which activities are you uncomfortable with right now?Remember that everyone has different boundaries and that all boundaries are valid. It is important to have these conversations to make sure that everyone is on the same page. Make sure that whoever you are with consents to any activity that you do. Consent is key in any relationship.<|endoftext|>"}

These differences, sometimes called desire discrepancy, can be a huge source of tension between partners and it\u2019s not always within our control. There are tons of factors that play into our desire for sex and with so many variables, it can feel difficult to understand. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to cover the factors involved and what to do about it.\u00a0Factors Influencing LibidoThere are a litany of factors that influence our libido, which is why it can fluctuate ever so frequently. Particularly in a time when more or less everyone\u2019s stress level is heightened, libidos are all over the place. Many people are experiencing a shift in how their libido functions and fluctuates; annoying for sure, but definitely normal. There are several reasons this fluctuation occurs, within or outside pandemic times.\u00a0\u00a0Hormones/BiologyHormones fluctuate for a variety of reasons like a menstrual cycle, stress (more on that next), and aging. As hormones fluctuate, they can affect your libido. This is a pretty unavoidable factor, but understanding how and when your hormones fluctuate might help you understand changes in your libido. If you\u2019re seriously concerned about how your hormones shift and the outfall from that, talk to your medical provider.\u00a0\u00a0Stress\u00a0Stress does some pretty crazy things to the body, including affecting libido. It both physically and mentally influences your desire to have sex. Physically, your hormone production changes when you\u2019re under stress like increased cortisol, which lowers libido. Mentally, when you have a busy brain you can\u2019t mindfully enjoy sexual pleasure as much and it can even preclude you from orgasming. Plus, stress by definition puts a strain which is exhausting, yet another reason you might not be feeling up to getting down.MedicationSome types of medications can suppress libido as a side effect, especially antidepressants. If this is the case for you and it is significantly hindering your enjoyment of life or otherwise undesirable, talk to your doctor about possibly adjusting your medication(s).\u00a0TraumaAny trauma, but especially sexual trauma, can negatively affect libido. Everyone reacts to trauma differently; some people become more sexual, some don\u2019t want anything to do with sex, and some fall in between.\u00a0Relationship to our bodies\u00a0Lots of people struggle with loving their own body, especially during a pandemic when people are stress eating and lacking access to their usual exercise resources. If you\u2019re feeling particularly down about your body, it could be affecting your sexual interest. When you feel unattractive or uncomfortable in your skin, it\u2019s less likely that you\u2019ll want to expose yourself and be vulnerable in that way with another person.\n\nWhat Can I Do?\u00a0While this is a frustrating issue, it\u2019s not insurmountable! Don\u2019t despair just yet because there are lots of things you can try.Schedule sexSo many romanticized sex scenes involve passionate, spur of the moment heat. That doesn\u2019t mean that planned sex is any less hot though! It doesn\u2019t have to be a buzzkill to the thrill; the lead-up and tension building to the time compound the excitement and anticipation. Especially in longer term relationships, sex can move to the back burner in favor of more urgent priorities. For healthy relationships (that involve people who do typically want to have sex, as opposed to people who do not typically want sex) sex can be both a fun, connecting experience and a way to increase physical and emotional intimacy. For these reasons, it\u2019s important to incorporate consistent sexual encounters into your life! Scheduling sex allows this to be a more conscious process of incorporation. It can relieve some of the stress of initiating sex and ensures that you make time for it. Of course, this isn\u2019t an iron-clad schedule! If the time rolls around and someone isn\u2019t feeling it, there should be no obligation to follow through. Perhaps you can agree on another pleasurable activity that everyone is up for, even if it\u2019s not sex, like like cuddling or kissing, which is elaborated on below.Determine the root issueWhen applicable, try to solve the root issues of a lacking libido (in the instance that this is not your norm). If it\u2019s stress, consider working with a psychotherapist to develop coping strategies and stronger self-care habits. If it is body image, do some body positive activities, join support groups on social media, speak to a psychotherapist, and read up. You get the point, effects on libido are a symptom; to really solve it long term, you need to address the root.\u00a0\u00a0If you wanna get something done, do it yourselfSelf-pleasure is important to a healthy sex life both because it helps you know your own body and preferences better, and because it nurtures your need for sexual fulfillment. It won\u2019t be the same as partnered sex but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s \u201cworse\u201d. Masturbation isn\u2019t the \u201cbackup option\u201d for sex; both masturbation and sex can, and for many people should, exist in a healthy sex life. For those wanting to treat themselves, consider investing in sex toys from a body-safe shop like Spectrum Boutique, Unbound, or Peepshow Toys.Consider an open relationship\u00a0Open relationships won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea but they\u2019re worth considering especially if mismatched libido is a persistent issue and causes tension in the relationship. One of our recent blog posts offers a guide for people considering an open relationship.\u00a0Say no\u00a0Everyone has the absolute, unquestionable right to say \u201cno,\u201d no questions asked. That being said, it might be beneficial for a relationship if when someone says no to sex, that they provide reassurance. This can help the person wanting sex to avoid feelings of undesirability or otherwise negative thoughts.\u00a0Explore non-sexual intimacy\u00a0Sometimes the desire for sex is rooted in a desire for physical touch. Even if one person involved in the relationship isn\u2019t wanting sex, it\u2019s worth having a conversation about how to incorporate other types of physical touch like cuddling or kissing routinely. It can increase feelings of intimacy and care without involving sex and this compromise can assuage the tension around mismatched libidos.\u00a0See a sex therapist\u00a0While there tends to be stigma around sex therapy, there shouldn\u2019t be! Sex therapy, for either an individual or for partners, is a great resource, particularly if differences in libido persistently cause conflict in a relationship. Embrace Sexual Wellness offers individual, relationship and sex therapy so if you\u2019re feeling like you need a facilitator to help you out, go for it. Investing in the wellness of yourself and your loved one(s) is essential to your happiness, regardless of whether that involves psychotherapy.\n\nDesire discrepancy isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault. Try to practice some empathy and think about how your partner might feel in addition to you. And always remember: this issue, like all other relationship issues, isn\u2019t one partner\u2019s fault (and so on and so forth when there are more than two involved); it\u2019s you all against the problem.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "embracesexualwellness", "text": "<|endoftext|>Discussing Your STI Status and Practicing Safer Sex\n\n\n\nSTIs, also known as sexually transmitted infections, are important to be aware of whether you are sexually active or not. More than 1 million STIs are acquired every day worldwide, yet there remains a stigma surrounding them and those that have them.\u00a0 But shame can be reduced by learning the facts. Few STIs are life-threatening and most are treatable. Having an STI doesn\u2019t mean that you are a \u2018dirty\u2019 person and is no different than contracting another type of infection, such as a sinus infection. Using the term \u2018dirty\u2019 is stigmatizing and hurtful. When we use the terms \u2018clean\u2019 and \u2018dirty\u2019 to describe sexual health we are implying that people with STIs are not healthy or moral people, which is not accurate and evokes shame. These terms are damaging to those who have STIs because it can make them feel as if there is something wrong with them.Discuss Your STI Status Before You Have SexIt can be difficult to talk to your partner about STIs, but it is an important conversation to have.\u00a0Before having sex with a new partner it\u2019s important to have a conversation about your STI status and expectations for getting tested. Even if you are using protection, such as condoms, that protect against STIs, you should regularly get tested to make sure that you are aware of your STI status. It is also critical to make sure that you and your partner are on the same page when it comes to expectations for testing and safer sex practices.It may make you more comfortable to have this conversation in a safe and private space. Make sure that you are alone and in a place where you feel comfortable to discuss private information. If you are having trouble beginning the conversation, that is okay. Some things you can ask about are your partner\u2019s sexual history, if they typically have sex with or without protection, what barrier methods they are open to using (e.g, internal condoms, external condoms, dental dams), when was the last time they got tested and what those results were, and if they have ever had an STI before.\u00a0Develop Healthy Sex PracticesIt is important to be open with your partner about what methods you will use to prevent STI transmission during sex. Creating an agreement is critical when beginning sex with a new partner so that you are on the same page about your expectations. Continue your dialogue about STI testing and status and make it clear that you want to engage in safer sex practices to protect against the transmisison of STIs.\u00a0To start off these conversations it can be helpful to let your partner know that you will be able to enjoy sex more if you know that you are in agreement about your sexual practices. Do you expect you or your partner to always wear a condom or use barriers like dental dams? Asking questions like these allow for you and your partner to create a clear plan together. If you are okay with them having sex with other people make it clear. It is important to be open about expectations if you and your partner are going to be sexually monogamous or not.Get TestedThe most important thing you can do after having an open conversation with your partner is to get tested. The CDC has extensive recommendations for how often you should get tested based on gender identity, sexual orientation, and number of sexual partners. However, it is recommended that you get tested with each new partner so that there is total transparency. Many are unaware of the \u201cwindow period\u201d, the time it takes for an STI test to read as positive after it is transmitted. While some STIs only take a week to show up in a test, others may take up to four months.Find a Testing Site Near YouSTI and Sexual Health HotlinesLower-risk activitiesIf you or your partner has an STI, or if you are not comfortable having sex right away, Planned Parenthood has a comprehensive list of lower-risk activities to be sexually intimate with another person. Some of these activities include outercourse, all sexual acts other than vaginal intercourse, and mutual masturbation, but for a comprehensive list, visit Planned Parenthood\u2019s website.\u00a0\u00a0Remember that having an STI is nothing to be ashamed of. The best thing you can do is to encourage an open dialogue with each new partner and get tested regularly. There are a variety of options available for those who have an STI. There are treatments such as antibiotics and antiviral drugs that can help with symptoms and in some cases get rid of the infection. If you test positive for an STI remember that you are not alone. There are many resources to help you manage the outbreak.<|endoftext|>"}

This may lead you to wonder if kinky sex is for you, and if so, how do you get started? Let\u2019s talk about it.\u00a0Defining kink\u00a0Before talking about how to get into kink, it\u2019s important to define what \u201ckink\u201d even is, and how it differs from phrases like BDSM and fetish. Kink refers to any non-traditional sex; traditional in this context means heterosexual, monogamous intercourse without a non-normative fantasy or desire involved. A kink is not a fetish, but a fetish is a type of kink. A fetish is defined as an attraction to an inanimate object or specific body parts (excluding the traditionally sexualized ones). Finally, BDSM stands for bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism. BDSM is often incorrectly used interchangeably with kink, the difference being that kink is a broader term and BDSM is a type of kink that involves power dynamics. Whatever you\u2019re into, kink, fetish, or BDSM, they all prioritize and require open communication and consent. To get a handle on the basic terminology, check out this glossary.\n\nTips for Getting Started1. Set expectations and boundaries\u00a0Before even dipping your toe in, sit down and have a conversation with your partner(s) about expectations, interests, and limits. Here are some guides for talking about kink with partner(s), and another useful tool is a kink compatibility quiz.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Safe Words: these are words that would not otherwise come up during sex (e.g. pineapple, vote, continent, etc.) that mean \u201cstop!\u201d Safe words are especially relevant during play involving consensual non-consent.\u00a0Boundaries: Setting boundaries is the best way to make sure everyone is comfortable and safe. If you aren\u2019t sure what your boundaries are, check out this checklist of common ones.\u00a0Communicating: The importance of ongoing communication and consent in kink cannot be overstated. Of course, communication and consent are important regardless of what kind of sex you have, but this becomes even more vital when having kinky sex because of the nature of the power dynamics involved.\n\n2. Dip your toe in\u00a0If you\u2019re intrigued by kink but you\u2019re not quite ready to dive in, that\u2019s okay!

While the holidays are often a time when people are encouraged to spread joy and be generous to others, the intense pressure of \u201cgiving enough\u201d and showing up for our families can really amount for a lousy holiday if we forget about our own self-care. Here are a few tips to help you toast to a healthy holiday season! It is perfectly okay if you don\u2019t feel like being joyful this time of year. Maybe the holiday season reminds you of a painful event in your life or you don't have any family nearby to celebrate with \u2014 there\u2019s no reason you should have to take a ride on the holly jolly trolly if you aren\u2019t feeling up to it. Instead, spend some time nourishing you and doing something cathartic like reading a book, meeting a friend for coffee, going ice skating or watching a new movie.If you are purchasing holiday gifts, stick to a budget that makes sense for you and do not spend more than you can afford. Spending extra now when you truly cannot afford it may lead to resentment and financial hardship later. Consider giving the gift of your time, a heartfelt card or experiences that can be financed over time like concert tickets. By following a strict budget for holiday shopping, you can walk into the new year feeling more financially stable and confident!Holiday travel can be hectic. If you are traveling this holiday season \u2014 be gentle to yourself and come prepared with calming essentials. Calming essentials are go-to items that will help you stay calm and bring you peace amidst chaotic circumstances. Not sure where to start? Now is the time to start packing. Some recommendations may include: your water bottle, tea or hot chocolate mix, positively energizing tunes, essential oils, hand salve/lotion, a cozy scarf or blanket, a favorite photo album (electronic may be best for traveling), a you-approved selection of podcasts/audiobooks/books, and don\u2019t forget your favorite snacks!Prioritize YOU-time. So often, we are expected to show up to holiday parties to socialize and be \u201con\u201d which can be draining, even for extroverts. If you have a lot of social events that you anticipate will zap your energy, take some time to plan lots of YOU-time before and afterwards to recharge and recover. While it may sound trivial to schedule YOU-time, you will thank yourself later and be glad you did. When we push ourselves too hard while running on empty, we are more prone to experience stress. Take the time this holiday season to get the rest you need and take care of you. That way, you\u2019ll be more fun to be around later when you rejoin the group!Know what would be absolutely perfection this holiday seasons? Letting go of perfection. It is far too easy to get caught up in a holiday headspace that is populated by Pinterest, but it\u2019s less easy to actually create in real life. Instead of trying to make your holiday table look exactly like the one you pinned and have been admiring for weeks, try to focus on one element that feels special for you. Maybe making your grandmother\u2019s recipe or hanging an heirloom ornament on the tree is really important or perhaps spending time with family or going to the movies is your thing. Instead of focusing on \u2018having it all\u2019, try to consider which aspect will bring you the most meaning and aim to make that one thing possible. Remember #managingexpectations makes for a better-than-perfect holiday!No matter where you find yourself this holiday season, remember to give yourself the gift of self-compassion - YOU deserve it!

All of the above?\u00a0Halloween costumes overwhelmingly adhere to the gender binary. From childhood, this expectation is ingrained in our minds and places inherent limitations on self-expression. Though much progress has been made over the past fifty years in terms of shifting views on gender roles and expectations, the binary still dictates how Western society functions. This carries over to the smallest of things, like Halloween costumes. Even though this may seem insignificant, Adie Nelson explains in their article \u201cThe Pink Dragon is Female: Halloween Costumes and Gender Markers\u201d that \u201c...the non-inclusive language commonly found in the names of many children\u2019s Halloween costumes reverberates throughout many other dimensions of the gendered social life depicted in this fantastical world. For example, the importance of participation in the paid-work world and financial success for men and of physical attractiveness and marriage for women is reinforced through costume names that reference masculine costumes by occupational roles or titles but describe feminine costumes via appearance and/or relationships (e.g. \u201cPoliceman\u201d vs. \u201cBeautiful Bride\u201d)\u201d (Nelson 2000).\u00a0The issue with enforcing expected gender roles by insisting on a \u201cgender aligned\u201d Halloween costume for your child is that it imposes arbitrary, unproductive stereotypes on them before they\u2019ve even gotten the chance to think beyond them. It disallows a child\u2019s natural inclination to explore themselves and their relationship to the world. It\u2019s important to make children feel that whoever they are and whatever they like, you will celebrate their identity. The idea is not to get rid of the idea of gender entirely but to take steps to ensure that the gender binary doesn\u2019t limit your child. Allow your child the space to decide if they want to wear a costume that does not align with their gender identity, or one that is gender neutral. Keep in mind, \u201cGender neutral\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean unisex, either. If that\u2019s what your child wants, then great! But taking a gender neutral approach to Halloween costumes means allowing your child to wear whatever they\u2019d like regardless of the gendered association with it. Letting your child choose a Halloween costume regardless of binary perceptions and associations is a great first step towards this.\u00a0\u00a0It's important to acknowledge that though the gender binary is impractical and inaccurate, the reality is that it is still very much enmeshed in the fabric of Western society. With that being said, it\u2019s not unthinkable that a child defying gender expectations would receive backlash from peers.\u00a0All children in our society are exposed to the idea that gender roles are rigid. However, there's no need to make your child conform to protect them from that backlash. More often then not, when presented with new information, children are able to adapt. Instead, empower your child to stand up to peers and share their knowledge of gender beyond the binary. If you still experience concern, advocate for your child. Speak to their teachers and parents of their friends. Instead of making your child conform, work on making their environment safer for them to explore their gender identity.\"At the end of the day, Halloween should be a fun, celebratory occasion.

Everything from roleplay to bondage to power exchange and beyond is a form of kink. All sorts of people engage in kink for a number of reasons. Kink can absolutely be done solely for pleasure but for some, kink is a tool for healing trauma. It\u2019s not a replacement for mental healthcare but it can be used to supplement that process. Kink offers a safe, controlled context for sexual trauma survivors to reclaim sexual confidence and comfort. While sexual trauma like assault is a non-consensual seizure of power and dominance, power exchange in a safe, kinky setting can be a consensual, healthy practice to reframe sexual trauma. Kink centers and emphasizes communication and consent which are vital tenets of any healthy sex.Oftentimes, the appeal of kink for sexual assault survivors is the opportunity to feel empowered, respected, and safe. Not everyone will find kink healing because trauma and the ensuing healing process is highly personal. Including kink in that process is one of many power reclamation strategies. In order to be healing though, it\u2019s important that kink is being practiced in a healthy, consensual, communicative way. Furthermore, just because kink may involve physical pain or name calling, does not equate it with self-harm. This excerpt from Dr. Joe Kort explains this further in a quote from A Beautiful Perspective:\u00a0\u201cself-harm breaks relationship contracts, puts yourself at risk for real harm from others or one\u2019s self, and doesn\u2019t stay within boundaries of physical and psychological safety\u2026 When you engage in healthy ways, you talk openly and honestly at length with the person you are going to engage with in kink, fetish or BDSM play. You have a safe word, you stop when you don\u2019t feel safe or comfortable, and the feelings are pleasurable and enjoyable and not shame-based.\u201d\u00a0Kink, especially that which includes inflicting pain, not only provides the physical catharsis facilitated by pain, but also allows the recipient to be in control of the pain so they can explore those sensations safely. Focusing on intense physical sensation can be a grounding experience that allows the stresses of the real world to momentarily cease. These positive aspects can only be attained when kink is practiced consensually, safely, and transparently.\n\nSafety and communication are key aspects of kink regardless of the context but they are all the more important when it\u2019s being used as an outlet to heal trauma. For those interested in trying kink, especially in a therapeutic capacity, you may consider hiring a sex worker. This will allow for the most controlled environment possible to try exactly what you\u2019re interested in.Before delving into any kinky endeavor, it\u2019s vital to do your research. Neglecting to do so poses significant risks to everyone involved.

Gift-giving can be daunting but a great starting point is to think about the recipient\u2019s primary love language(s ).The idea of the five love languages is based on The 5 Love Languages book by Dr. Gary Chapman, a marriage counselor*. The website explains that when you identify the love languages preferences of yourself and the people you love, you can connect on a deeper level and understand how to fulfill needs more easily and effectively. The five outlined are acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time, words of affirmation, and physical touch.\n\nGift Ideas\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acts of Service\u00a0For people who receive love primarily through acts of service, it\u2019s most meaningful when their loved ones help them out by doing things like making them breakfast, taking over a chore for them, or running an errand for them.\u00a0Cooking them a mealBringing them breakfast in bedMaking a \u201ccoupon book\u201d with various chores and errands that the recipient can cash in when they want the giver to take over that taskGive them a gift card for a home cleaning serviceReceiving GiftsFor people who receive love primarily through receiving gifts, they feel loved when they receive meaningful tangible items. A common misconception is that people with this love language are greedy or materialistic; however, it\u2019s not about what the item is but about giving them a tangible reminder that they are loved. For this love language, gift-giving is a little different because it will highly vary from person to person what will mean the most.\u00a0Consider a multi-part gift that requires opening several packages. This might be something like a spa set where each package has a different self-care item or a customized puzzle where you give them the pieces over a course of days and they have to figure out how to assemble it. If you\u2019re not feeling inspired, there\u2019s also a resource called The Days of Gifts that sends multi-day gift packages based on a questionnaire filled out by the giver.\u00a0Subscription-based gifts are another great \u201cgift that keeps on giving\u201d for your gift-receiving love language loved one.Something sentimental like a customized accessory with a photo attached to a fun memory\u00a0Quality TimeFor people who receive love primarily through quality time, they feel the most loved when they get to spend uninterrupted time with their loved one.\u00a0Plan an adventure whether that\u2019s a day trip to a nearby city or hiking or whatever other kind of excursion suits the recipient\u2019s interestsMake a date jar (regardless of whether it\u2019s a romantic or platonic relationship!). Get a container (if you\u2019re feeling crafty, you can decorate it too!) and fill it with slips of paper with ideas for ways you can spend time togetherTake a cooking class together\u00a0Words of AffirmationFor people who receive love primarily through words of affirmation, they feel the most loved when their loved ones share written or spoken kind and complimentary words.\u00a0Make an affirmation jar! Similar to the concept of the date jar, this involves getting a container and filling it with slips of paper with compliments and kind words about the recipientMarkup a favorite book with notes, inside jokes, and surprises like fun stickersCommission a photo word portrait. You send the artist any words, whether that\u2019s a favorite poem or a letter you write yourself, and a photo and they combine the two to make a beautiful sentimental giftPhysical Touch\u00a0For people who receive love primarily through physical touch, they feel the most loved when they get to be physically affectionate with their loved ones.\u00a0Buy some nice massage oils and give them a massage (this would likely be suitable only for romantic partners or close friends). If you\u2019re not confident in your massage skills, book them a professional massage instead\u00a0Get them a weighted blanket, which many people find soothing and cozy\u00a0A \u201c5 senses\u201d gift where you pick out special items coordinating with each sense like their favorite snack for taste or their favorite cologne for smellAt the end of the day, the most important thing is that you put thought into your gifts because as long as you do that, it\u2019s hard to go wrong. Even by reading this article, you clearly care about making your loved ones feel loved and are already putting thought into your gifts. Be thoughtful but don\u2019t overthink or overly stress yourself out about it. Happy gift-giving!*Disclaimer: ESW does not endorse the views of Gary Chapman.

Sex included.\u00a0Often after going out with a new special someone, we chat with our friends, coworkers or family about the experience. Then what happens? Opinions. Lots of them. These people who are close to us impart their ideas about the date (or series of dates), \"He took you where?\" or \"She said what?\" and then we download a new perspective entirely. See how easy it is for our inner circle to influence our decisions...Let's make this decision YOURS.Sex brings up a lot for people whether it be intense emotions, past experiences, ideas about\u00a0commitment, concerns about STIs/unplanned pregnancy, body image, cultural understandings and religious beliefs, etc. If you consult every person from your inner circle, they may each give you different answers based on their own beliefs.. making it more\u00a0complicated than calculated. What matters most is what you believe and whether you feel prepared to engage sexually with this other person.The right time to have sex for one person is unlikely to\u00a0be the same for another, so there's no quantitative one-size-fits-all answer. \u00a0However, here are a few of my favorite questions to consider when making your\u00a0decision:Can you talk about being intimate while you're not in the heat of the moment?Discussing what you desire in an intimate relationship with your date, while you are fully clothed\u00a0and sipping coffee, can be just as sexy as that steamy kiss you shared last Friday night. Think of this as foreplay for your brain. It also helps clear up any expectations you each may have.If you were sexually intimate right now, what do you imagine that would be like for you?Sometimes new (sexual) experiences are exciting and other times they feel scary. If you notice that you feel uneasy\u00a0about having sex right now, I'd encourage you to embrace that and not make any decision that doesn't feel right to YOU. Identifying the source of the discomfort can be helpful to determine: What might help you feel more comfortable? Many people feel anxious about having sex because\u00a0they worry about unplanned pregnancy or contracting an STI. One strategy to yield the nerves would be to talk with your partner about your beliefs about contraception and plans for safer sex. Pro tip: Make your next date a trip to the local clinic to get tested together for STIs.What are 5 things you like about this person that are not visible to the naked eye?\u00a0This one may sound silly, yet it is important to like our partners if we are taking stock in exploring their bodies sexually. Now, maybe you don't feel that being \"in love\" is a prerequisite for sex, totally fair. \u00a0However, if you are going to be trusting your body with someone (and during sex, trust is involved), finding 5 things you can appreciate about him or her should be easy to do. Think about it this way: if you knew your date didn't like you as a person, would you still want to be with them sexually?What are the tradeoffs of waiting\u00a0to be sexual?If sex were a car and desire were gasoline, then distance is desire's gasoline. That first moment when you greet your date after nearly a week and you've been thinking about one another frequently, KABOOM! Those few days apart (that distance) is what makes your first interaction feel so powerful and exciting.\n\nSo maybe you both have been kissing a lot and that feels good right now and you are considering taking things to the next level sexually, awesome. Here's a question: if you waited a little while longer (maybe a day or a few more weeks), what would you gain instead? Often when I ask this question, people seem confused but their answers usually reside with closeness, greater\u00a0confidence, a deepened sense of trust, more developed commitment, increased awareness &\u00a0Desire, Desire, Desire.\u00a0Taking the time to really understand the person you swiped right will likely enhance your sexual experience in the long run, keeping the anticipation flowing until you are both ready to embark on this sexual expedition.<|endoftext|>"}

While we cannot control the world around us, we can model safety, consent, and pleasure for the young people in our lives. Being a sex-positive caregiver is more than explaining anatomy and the mechanics of reproduction. Rather, sex-positive parenting is a holistic practice that embraces sexuality as an essential aspect of self.\u00a0START A DIALOGUEThere is no right time to have the \u201ctalk\u201d because sexuality is always evolving. How you educate your child will look different at the varying stages of their development. It may be tempting to avoid talking about sexuality with your children, but that won\u2019t set them up for success. Being a sex-positive parent means actively teaching young people about sex, bodies, healthy relationships and pleasure, instead of waiting for them to learn solely from their peers or the internet. According to the Pediatric Clinics of North America, a parent's role in sexuality education is vital and is associated with increased engagement in safer sex practices during adolescence.\n\nWHERE TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATIONStart early. According to the CDC, by age 2+ your child will begin to identify certain body parts. Use scientifically accurate terminology (e.g., vulva, penis, scrotum and nipples) during everyday activities including bath time and diaper changes. By normalizing use of accurate names of body parts, your child will be better able to communicate with you if they have an injury or are experiencing any discomfort. During bath time you can discuss the importance of hygiene and demonstrate how to properly wash their genitals, while teaching them to do so on their own as they develop.\u00a0Create a judgment free zone. Toddlers commonly touch their genitals, so if you see your child exploring their genitals, let them know that touching their own body can feel good and it is also something to do in the privacy of their own rooms. Oftentimes, genital exploration is more about self soothing versus sexual stimulation and this is a normal part of development. This can also be an opportunity to talk about boundaries and which parts of the home are on versus off limits for self-exploration. For example, if your child\u00a0 begins touching their genitals at the dinner table, you can reiterate that they are welcome to touch themselves in their room or bathroom, but not at the dinner table. As you child develops, their curiosity around sexuality and self pleasure may increase.\u00a0Safer sex. Discuss different types of sex with your adolescents such as dry humping, oral, anal, and vaginal intercourse. Explain that some forms of sexual exploration may be safer than others, and while abstinence is an option, it is most important that they are informed about their body and how to practice safer sex before doing so with a partner. Research suggests that abstinence-only education methods are ineffective in reducing teenage pregnancy and may have an inverse effect on pregnancy outcomes whereas comprehensive sexuality education better prepares young people to be informed and sexually responsible.\u00a0Making condoms and dental dams easily available at home (i.e., in a bathroom drawer) and talking with teens about birth control options can help them be more prepared for practicing safer sex.\n\nPhoto by Kinkazoid\n\nTHINGS TO DOEducate your kiddos. Share educational videos with your child and stock their at-home library with developmentally appropriate sexuality books. According to Planned Parenthood, reading books with younger children is a great way to introduce them to the subject of sexuality. Children age 10+ may benefit from reading on their own and then checking in with you afterwards. If reading independently, ask your child what they learned and if they have any questions. Monitor your own reactions by taking a moment to breathe and collect your thoughts before answering questions. If you\u2019re not sure how to answer a question, tell them that you have to think about their question because you value their curiosity and you\u2019ll get back to them.\u00a0Normalize conversations about bodies and sex. Having regular conversations about sexuality and pleasure demonstrates that these topics are important and normal. By beginning the dialogue early, you will be able to share developmental information slowly, at a digestible pace. Children are eager to learn and having access to developmentally appropriate information is key. For example, if your child asks you where babies come from, your answer will be different when they are pre-kindergarten compared to in fifth grade. When your child is in kindergarten, you may say babies come out of a pregnant person\u2019s uterus. However, as they develop, your explanations will begin to become more complex. Starting around fourth grade you may introduce the concept of gestation and birth through the vaginal canal. When talking about sexuality to your eighth grader, include STI\u2019s, pregnancy prevention, pleasure, and how one can enjoy themselves solo or with a partner(s).\n\nTOPICS TO INCLUDEMedia Literacy. Media literacy is a concept that is particularly useful when educating young people about body image and sexually explicit materials. By explaining that movies are made for entertainment and that real life can be very different from what they see online or on television, this helps them develop more realistic expectations. The goal here is for young people to interact with all forms of media while thinking critically about the content they are viewing.\u00a0Pornography. If you find your child exploring pornography, it is important to communicate that porn is designed for adult entertainment and explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Talking about porn can be an opportunity to explore how all bodies are different and all bodies are beautiful. While you can put parental controls on your devices at home, this won\u2019t stop a curious child from exploring pornography outside of the home. Thus, it is important to talk about the unrealistic aspects of media and how that might affect their view of sexuality and pleasure.\u00a0Consent. Practicing consent with children throughout the life course promotes safety, respect, boundaries and builds healthy relationships. Encourage young people to ask before engaging in physical affection (e.g., hugs) and say so if they do not want physical affection from a family member. Model consent in conversation by asking children for permission before touching them. Tickling is another opportunity to demonstrate consent. Ask for permission before beginning, and listen to your child when they want you to stop during tickling sessions. When being affectionate with your partner(s) in front of your child, ask your partner(s) for a kiss or a hug and then proceed only after your partner clearly expresses a yes. This helps reinforce consent and bodily autonomy.\u00a0Boundaries. Kids mirror and absorb so much information through nonverbal and verbal communication, including through your relationship with other adults. Having healthy boundaries benefits children throughout their lives, especially when it comes to sexuality. By teaching and modeling how to create and communicate boundaries, your child will be better able to advocate for themselves in relationships with others.\n\nThe benefits to being a sex-positive caregiver will outweigh any discomfort that may initially come up for you. Taking an active role in children\u2019s sexuality education is crucial to their wellbeing.

Parents also do not always have the right answer. That\u2019s okay! That\u2019s where we come in. If you aren\u2019t sure what to do if or when your child comes out to you, this article is a good starting point. The most important thing you can do is validate your child\u2019s experience and make sure they know you love them no matter how they identify.\u00a0WHAT TO DOThank them for trusting you with this vulnerable information (e.g., their feelings, disclosure, identity, etc.)\u00a0Listen to understand, not to respond\u00a0Ask how you can best support them. They may not know immediately, but it\u2019s important that they know you want to support them and are open for feedbackRead up more about the identity they have shared with you. Organizations like Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) are a great resourceMake sure they know that you love them and that your love is not conditionalAsk for help! If you leave a coming out conversation with your child feeling like your head is spinning, try to find a support resource that will work for you. Maybe that looks like attending a PFLAG meeting, reaching out to a sexuality educator or family therapist who specializes in working with LGTBQ+ individuals, or cruising vetted online forums. There are tons of resources for people just like you; you\u2019re not alone! *There is a contingency with whom you can ask for help. See below for elaboration.\n\nWHAT NOT TO DO:\u00a0Avoid saying,\u201cI knew it!\u201d or any variation thereof, even if you did have a hunch. This is a vulnerable moment for your child and they probably had to work up immense courage to tell you. If you say you already knew, it deflates the emotional labor they put in to be able to tell you.\u00a0Do not say, \u201cyou\u2019re too young to know!\u201d. First of all, youth do know what their truth is right now and they have just told it to you. It does no one any good for you to try to dispute their feelings because feelings can\u2019t be wrong. Children generally know their gender identity by age 5 and sexual orientation in later childhood/early teen hood. Please note, however, that these are not hard and fast \u201cdeadlines,\u201d but touch-points-of-guidance. Maybe down the line they\u2019ll identify differently and that\u2019s normal, because sexuality is fluid. Either way, all you accomplish by saying this is invalidating them and making them lose trust in you.\u00a0If you have some internalized shame or beliefs that\u2019s fine, almost everyone does. It\u2019s how we\u2019ve been societally conditioned. That being said, it is your issue to work through, not your child\u2019s. Do not put those feelings on them. Avoid burdening your child with your own discomfort around non-straight orientations or non-cisgender gender identities.\u00a0Never pressure them to share more or to tell you anything they aren\u2019t comfortable talking about. Let them come to you when they\u2019re ready.*Definitely avoid telling anyone else before your child discloses to them or gives you explicit permission. Anyone else can include your partner(s), sibling(s), best friend,... it means no one. This is your child\u2019s information to share and theirs alone.\n\nWhen a child is coming out to you, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed or unsure exactly what to say. It makes sense if you want to do the best for your child and feel insecure at the same time. Don\u2019t make this out to be more than it is; that will only make you and your child uncomfortable and/or more anxious. At the end of the day, let them do the talking, respond with love and validation, and the rest will follow. The only thing left to do is for you to stock up on rainbow clothing!<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "embracesexualwellness", "text": "<|endoftext|>Intimacy After Childbirth\n\n\n\nGiving birth is one of the most incredible acts a human body can perform, as well as one of the most strenuous. After a hormonal, physically traumatic experience, it\u2019s not uncommon for birth givers to not want intimacy afterwards. On top of the physical effects to the body and the emotional drain of birth, intimacy can be a difficult activity to prioritize with a newborn to tend to which sometimes involves breastfeeding, which is additionally physically draining.\u00a0Generally, it takes six weeks from birth to be fully healed in and around the vulva and vagina, though this timeline varies from person to person. Engaging in penetrative intimate acts is generally not advisable before fully healing. That being said, each individual should prioritize the advice from their healthcare professional. It\u2019s important to note that if and when everyone involved in the relationship does feel ready for penetrative sex, contraception is still vital as pregnancy is a risk regardless of whether or not the birthgiver is breastfeeding and whether or not their period has resumed.\u00a0All partners involved should focus on practicing patience and flexibility with the postpartum intimacy timeline because you may feel ready at different paces. It\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll gradually progress, rather than going from feeling unready for any intimacy to ready for all types of intimacy in an instant. The progression might not even be linear, and it\u2019s important to maintain an open line of communication as needs and boundaries shift.\u00a0Both physical and emotional changes will factor into your timeline and individual boundaries and needs. Some physical changes after birth for the birth giver that may occur are aches and pains, vaginal dryness, and hormonal imbalances. All partners may experience exhaustion, feeling \u201ctouched out\u201d from handling the newborn all day, and general emotional overwhelmedness. The changing dynamic that results from a child, whether they\u2019re the first child or not, can be frustrating and difficult to navigate, resulting in feeling emotionally drained. For the birth giver, body image may additionally be difficult to navigate postpartum and intimacy may feel too exposing. Furthermore, for birth givers that choose to breastfeed, nursing releases oxytocin which increases bonding with the child but suppresses libido. Though physical intimacy may feel difficult in the midst of all these changes, it\u2019s an important part of feeling connected to your partner(s).\n\nAs you navigate postpartum intimacy, you may want to keep the following tips in mind...Intimacy can look many ways and doesn\u2019t necessarily need to have a sexual connotation. Cuddling, giving each other massages, and even emotional conversations can foster a feeling of intimacy.\u00a0It\u2019s possible that intimacy won\u2019t feel as good or desirable immediately after birth as it did before birth but that doesn\u2019t mean it will stay that way forever.If physical intimacy doesn\u2019t feel feasible, simply making time for one another and small caring gestures can make all the difference in maintaining an intimate emotional connection.\u00a0Physical intimacy and sex should happen on your terms, not how you feel you \u201cshould\u201d practice it. Length and timing of intimacy, type of intimacy, or any other factor should function to make you feel connected and comfortable.\u00a0For instance, though typically sensual time has a nighttime connotation, this doesn\u2019t have to be the case. Especially for exhausted parents, bedtime may not foster a desire for intimacy. Shifting to earlier timing might be a good option when your schedules allow.\u00a0Another example is length of intimacy; intimacy and sex don\u2019t need to be long, drawn out sessions if that doesn\u2019t sound good. Quickies are your friend!\u00a0Remember that while changes in a relationship dynamic, changes in libido, hormonal changes, and low energy are frustrating parts of navigating postpartum life, they are all completely normal. They, too, shall pass.\u00a0Everyone\u2019s postpartum intimacy journey is a deeply personal experience but some useful external resources that may help guide you are\u2026\u00a0Sexual health and intimacy after childbirthFirst-time parents' experiences of proximity and intimacy after childbirth - A qualitative studySex After Birth: What to Expect and How Long to WaitSexual Intimacy After Childbirth: When It Isn't Like BeforeAbove all, give yourself and your partner(s) as much grace as possible and try to practice patience.

Receiving healthcare is often a vulnerable position to be in and when the risk of discrimination is that much higher, many LGBTQIA+ folks hesitate to take the chance even if it means denying themselves critical care.\u00a0According to a report by Lambda Legal, \u201calmost 56% of lesbian, gay, or bisexual respondents had at least one of these [various negative types of interaction with healthcare professionals] experiences; 70% of transgender and gender nonconforming respondents had one or more of these experiences.\u201d Those kinds of numbers make it abundantly clear that LGBTQIA+ individuals are consistently discriminated against in healthcare environments and this discourages them from seeking needed care; not to mention that in some U.S. states, healthcare professionals can legally turn away an individual for being LGBTQIA+.\u00a0These systemic issues need to be addressed but at the same time, LGBTQIA+ people are suffering at the hands of healthcare discrimination which has potentially life threatening consequences. There is room both to critique the system and recognize that it needs to be overhauled, as well as to acknowledge that people need access to compassionate care now. Both healthcare providers and LGBTQIA+ patients can take measures to make healthcare a more accessible and affirming experience. There are strategies to mitigate discrimination and exposure to it despite the fact that it may not be entirely unavoidable.\n\nFor Healthcare Professionals: Curating an LGBTQIA+ Welcoming Environment\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change starts on an individual level and all healthcare professionals should strive to address the unique hurdles LGBTQIA+ people face when seeking care. Here are some ways to practice LGBTQIA+ affirming care:Ask patients\u2019 pronouns and default to gender neutral language if their pronouns are unknown. Additionally, make space for patients to disclose both their legal name and the name they identify with as sometimes they are different, especially for transgender people.\u00a0Explicitly display support for LGBTQIA+ people and their healthDisplay brochures (multilingual when possible and appropriate) about LGBT health concerns, such as breast cancer, safe sex, hormone therapy, mental health, substance use, and sexually transmitted infections.Hire LGBTQIA+ staff membersAttend and support local LGBTQIA+ events and businesses\u00a0Publish a non-discrimination statement such as this example.\u00a0Allow for a wide variety of identities and boundaries on intake forms\u00a0This may include replacing the strict male/female options with blank spaces for both \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex\u201d categories.Add room for patients to specify what name they\u2019d like to be called, in addition to their legal name\u00a0Allow people to disclose boundaries for the doctor such as not wanting to be weighed or not wanting a genital exam (unless explicitly necessary to the health concern at hand)\u00a0Commit to continually learning and improving, especially in instances when you have made a mistake.\u00a0Read our blog post with a round up of LGBTQIA+ education resources\u00a0Don\u2019t assume anyone\u2019s gender, anatomy, or sexualityListen to how patients describe their own sexual orientation, partner(s), gender, and relationship(s), and use their language. Although many LGBT people may use words such as \u201cqueer,\u201d \u201cdyke,\u201d and \u201cfag\u201d to describe themselves, these and other words have been derogatory terms used against LGBT individuals. They are not appropriate for use by health care providers unless and until explicit consent is given by the patient. If you are in doubt as to how to refer to a patient, ask what word or phrase they prefer.Ensure there is a gender neutral restroom option for patients\n\nFor LGBTQIA+ Individuals: How to Protect YourselfWhen searching for doctors, utilize resources such as a local LGBTQ+ clinics and centers for recommendations, or a directory like the one from the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association.Look up reviews of a potential doctor to learn more about their patients\u2019 experiences.Explore the practice\u2019s website to see if they explicitly display support for LGBTQIA+ people.If you have questions for the doctor before you feel comfortable going in for an appointment, try emailing or calling the office and ask them questions about their experience working with LGBTQIA+ patients. Listen to your gut feeling about them after your call.If possible, consider bringing a trusted friend, someone you feel safe and comfortable around, to your appointment.\u00a0Your doctor\u2019s job is to take care of you; the best way you can help them do that is by being upfront about your boundaries and any pertinent information about yourself, including your identity. Any good doctor will appreciate the guidance and unless your requests go against medical necessity, they should respect it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you have a negative experience with a healthcare professional, make sure to practice self-care and process it with a trusted therapist if you have access to one. If not, talk with a consenting loved one about your experience.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully these tips will assist both healthcare professionals and LGBTQIA+ patients to make LGBTQIA+ healthcare affirming, compassionate, and accessible. No one\u2019s health should suffer because of ignorance. Healthcare is a human right for all, not just those who conform to arbitrary societal standards. LGBTQIA+ people deserve equitable access to proper healthcare.<|endoftext|>"}

It takes work to nurture the relationship and work through conflict, but it certainly can be a daunting task. Not everyone is fortunate enough to grow up around role models of healthy relationships which can make navigating relationship conflict even more frustrating. Luckily, relationship conflict is nothing new and there are tons of ways to make it less stressful for you and your partner(s). It\u2019s important to be able to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy conflict management, to understand one\u2019s own emotion regulation capacity, and to communicate effectively and efficiently. No two relationships are made the same so not every tactic will work for every person or dynamic, but there are general principles that have a wide range of applications. Let\u2019s talk about some of them.\n\nHealthy Conflict Vs. Abusive Conflict\u00a0Healthy conflict is when...Partners choose words that are respectful and don\u2019t attack a person\u2019s character, call them names, or raise their voice at them.\u00a0All partners feel safe bringing up issues without fear of retaliation.Partners practice active listening and healthy communication techniques (more on those later!).\u00a0Boundaries are respected.\u00a0Apologies are genuine and not predicated on excuses or invalidating the recipient\u2019s feelings.The goal is to ultimately find the underlying foundational cause of the conflict in order to address the problem at the root.All people involved are in a clear, wise minded headspace coming into the argument.\u00a0Partners are making requests instead of complaints. For example, instead of \u201cyou never ask me how my day was when I come home,\u201d you might try something like \u201chey when my day is over I like to decompress by talking about it. Would you mind making an effort to ask me about it?\u201d.It may be an abusive conflict if...It involves physical harm, emotional manipulation, yelling, name-calling, or personal attacks.The conflict surrounds one partner attempting to overly control the other(s) such as disallowing socializing outside the relationship.The conflict surrounds a partner\u2019s jealous or possessive behavior.\u00a0Conflict arises more often than not and the relationship feels like a constant uphill battle full of arguments.The same issues come up repeatedly without appropriate behavioral changes being made.\n\nCommunication TipsSpeak your mind in a timely manner, don\u2019t let resentment buildTake time outs if needed. When one or multiple partners are in an intense emotional headspace, it\u2019s near impossible to have a productive, effective conversation. Make time to cool down when needed but set a specific time limit for the break, whether that\u2019s minutes, hours, or days, so that the conversation doesn\u2019t accidentally fall by the wayside.\u00a0Speak from the \u201cI\u201d perspective and avoid making assumptions about the offending person\u2019s intent. For example, instead of \u201cyou don\u2019t care about my hobbies,\u201d you might say something like \u201cI feel unappreciated when you neglect to listen to me talk about my hobbies.\u201d\u00a0Approach the conflict as all partner(s) versus the conflict rather than partner(s) versus partner(s). The goal is to work together to solve the problem, not to create adversity.\u00a0Practice genuine, reparative apologizing. To learn more about how to do that, check out this Time Magazine article.When possible, give the other party/ies the benefit of the doubt. Most people are trying their very best at any given moment. This doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t hold them accountable or you shouldn\u2019t have your needs met, only that you should do your best to give them grace.Figure out what coping tactics work best to regulate your own emotions. Emotion regulation and interpersonal communication skills based in dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) work well for many people. Try to prioritize being effective over being right. Sometimes you may need to agree to disagree instead of beating a dead horse and sowing additional discord.\tIf you incorporate these tips and skills into your conflict management and you still encounter significant obstacles, consider working with a systemically trained relationship therapist like our team of clinicians. Conflict arises in all healthy relationships and does not mean the relationship is doomed. The difference between healthy and abusive relationships in terms of conflict is how it is handled. The better everyone involved understands emotion regulation and conflict management, the more effective conflict management will become. All relationships are a work in progress and luckily, by definition, you don\u2019t need to work on it alone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Additional Resources\u00a0\u00a0How to Determine and Communicate Boundaries in RelationshipsResistance and Conflict in DBT\u00a0How to Apologize to Different People in Your LifeEmotion Regulation in DBT\u00a0\u00a0Conflict resolution\u00a010 Rules for Constructive Conflict7 Tips for Handling Conflict in Your RelationshipManaging Versus Resolving Conflict\u00a024 Tips for Conflict Resolution in an Intimate Relationship<|endoftext|>"}

As a clinician, I notice many clients wanting to learn more but feeling confused about where to begin.To break it down for you, the nuts and bolts of incorporating mindfulness in your life on a regular basis, let\u2019s start with a definition. What exactly is mindfulness?Mindfulness is the act of being in the present and bringing one\u2019s awareness to what is happening in front of you at this very moment. Merriam-Webster defines mindfulness as the practice of maintaining a nonjudgmental state of heightened or complete awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, or experiences on a moment-to-moment basis; such a state of awareness.So, you\u2019re supposed to pay attention to your thoughts, emotions and experiences \u2013 now what?Practicing mindfulness in every day life can be tricky. Let\u2019s look at right now for example- as you are reading the words in this article, consider your thoughts. What are you thinking about?Perhaps you are thinking about what comes next as you skim through the article. Maybe you wore an itchy sweater to work and are currently noticing how uncomfortable it feels on your skin. Or maybe you fought with your partner this morning and you can\u2019t stop thinking about it.Take a second and reflect \u2013 what is on your mind? Are you able to really read these words and stay focused?These are examples of how our thoughts can interject in the moment and distract us from the task at hand. Now, consider how often you find yourself thinking about something other than what you are currently doing. It can be hard to stay focused on the present especially when we have so many gears turning in our lives. I\u2019d like to share with some strategies for applying mindfulness to everyday tasks:1. Washing the dishes.BORING, right? Maybe you enjoy doing the dishes, but more than likely, you are just going through household chores and crossing it off your list. Next time you are doing dishes, pause to reflect on all the steps that are involved while noticing how your senses are involved. When you are scraping the excess food off of the plate, bring your attention to the motion you use to do so. Do you use a sponge or scrubber brush to remove sticky substances or do you use your hands? Notice the sensation. Are there certain motions that work better than others? Feel the temperature of the water as it crashes onto the plate. If you applied soap, maybe a certain scent fills the air around you. Take that in.What is it like to be reflecting on the process of washing your dishes this way? How might this activity seem different to you now that you are directing your awareness to it?2. Workouts @ The GymOne of my favorite ways to practice mindfulness is while working out. Why then? It is sweaty and loud and there are so many distractions\u2026 this is precisely why. When we are prone to distractions or self-criticism, these moments are excellent for re-centering our body awareness.So, you are at the gym in the middle of a workout. You are on rep 7 of 10 \u00a0squat jumps and your mind is entirely checked out. This is a perfect time to reel it back in, here\u2019s how:As you look into the mirror, what do you see? Be your own witness. Take a moment to notice the form your body makes when you bend your knees, sitting back deeply into a squat position. Feel the distribution of weight into your heels as you sit back and the air underneath your feet as you jump into the air. Become attuned to the pace of your breathing \u2013 at what point are you inhaling and exhaling? What sounds do you notice when you land on your feet or jump into the air from your squat? Are you listening to music? If so, what tunes are in the background?If a thought comes up and interrupts your sequence, acknowledge that thought and push it aside for right now. It can wait until you are done with your 10 reps or maybe even your entire workout.3. Bathing & ShoweringShowering or bathing is part of your routine \u2013 so consider it another chance to practice mindfulness. Showering is an especially rich opportunity to engage in mindfulness because there are so many bodily sensations being activated during the process. What makes this shower different from an ordinary shower?That would be the presence of intention. \u201cIntentional Showering\u201d involves a shift in awareness to bodily sensations that may not be attuned to on a regular basis.First, consider what time of day are you showering. If it is early in the morning, how might that feel different from if it were later in the day or evening? Notice how much light is present around you as you shower. How might the experience be different with varied amounts of light? What items surround you in the shower? Maybe there are shampoo bottles or maybe there are rubber duck toys or fluffy loofas - how might these sights shape your experience?Now bring your attention to the temperature of the water and how it feels against your skin. As you begin cleansing yourself, direct your awareness to the motion in which you are cleansing. Pause for a second. Maybe you use a washcloth, a loofa, or your hand. Is there a particular order you follow while cleansing your body? What sounds are present as you shower? Do you listen to a radio, sing, or shower silently? What scents are present for you as you cleanse? As you notice each of these sensations, I invite you to reflect \u2013 how might this change your showering/bathing experience?Mindfulness is called a practice for a reason. The more often we engage in the practice, the more opportunities we have for learning and growth. When we pause to thoughtfully reflect on our lives in a slow and intentional way, we train ourselves to appreciate the power of living in the present.I encourage you to incorporate a daily practice for at least a week. Perhaps you have your own ideas or unique ways of incorporating a mindfulness practice that are a better fit for you? Go for it. Run with them. Let me know how it goes \u2013 I\u2019d be honored to hear your feedback.<|endoftext|>"}

Sexual trauma can be caused by any kind of non-consensual sexual experience; including rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and childhood molestation. Given that trauma is subjective, it is up to the individual to determine how to define their experience. On average, there are 450,000+ victims of rape and sexual assault every year in the United States, a number which is likely underreported. Survivors of sexual trauma frequently struggle with PTSD and are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol to cope. Experiencing sexual trauma has the potential to upend someone\u2019s entire life, not least of all their sex life. Trauma responses can range from sex repulsion to hypersexuality. There is no one timeline or coping strategy that will work for every survivor of sexual assault so the most important part is to respect one\u2019s own boundaries and to move at a pace that feels comfortable. There\u2019s no obligation to return to consensual sex but for those who want that, healing is possible, even if it is sometimes challenging.\u00a0Common obstacles to resuming consensual intimacy may include negative body image, flashbacks, and PTSD. If it\u2019s accessible to you, work with a trauma informed therapist to facilitate your healing process. Embrace Sexual Wellness offers therapy to address sexual trauma concerns and you can learn more about our services here.

To kick off June, we\u2019re building off a previous article about supporting your child when they come out as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community. Supporting a child when they come out is vital to building trust and support between you but just as important, if not more important, is the ensuing ongoing support on a quotidian basis. This will naturally look somewhat different from family to family, identity to identity, age to age, and so on, but the general principles of honesty, support, and love apply to every circumstance.\u00a0A few basic tips include\u00a0Be willing to suspend your preconceived notions of gender and sexualityBe prepared to be confused and sometimes overwhelmedBe willing to be a learner and not a teacherBe open to asking questions rather than making assumptionsIn addition to these tips, a major way you can support an LGBTQIA+ child is by doing your research if you haven\u2019t already. There is an abundance of readily accessible educational materials available online so while this blog post will mention a few, it is by no means an exhaustive list of useful resources. It\u2019s important to not only understand your child\u2019s personal experience, but also the societal structures and the gender binary as a whole in order to fully understand how your child fits into the world around them. Once you feel more familiar with the concept, you can start helping your child to understand it and themselves more fully. It\u2019s understandable to be overwhelmed; if you aren\u2019t already familiar with these ideas, they can be a lot to process. Throughout this process, pay attention to your feelings and make sure you\u2019re practicing adequate self-care in order to sustainably support your child long term.\u00a0Gender IdentityThe following resources are excerpted from a resource page related to a zine about the gender binary. You can find the full list here. Embrace Sexual Wellness also has its own resource page here.Explained: Difference between gender, gender expression\u00a0GLAAD Media Reference Guide - TransgenderThe Coloniality of GenderThe Struggles of Rejecting the Gender Binary\u00a0Understanding Non-Binary PeopleWhat Is Gender Expression?How to use neopronouns in sentencesInclusivity tipsMap of Gender diverse CulturesMore on Neopronouns (further resources included on the page)\u00a0You Could Never Misgender MeFemale Masculinity - Jack Halberstam (published under \u201cJudith Halberstam\u201d)Gender Outlaw - Kate BornsteinHow Beautiful The Ordinary: Twelve Stories Of Identity - Ed.

PreciadoIf you\u2019re struggling to process all this new information, consider joining a support group like those run by PFLAG. You can find your local chapter here. Also consider looking into whether or not you have a local independently run LGBTQIA+ support and wellness center.\u00a0Beyond educating yourself and your child about their identity, tangible ways you can support your LGBTQIA+ child are to get involved in local activism for LGBTQIA+ rights, support their autonomous self-expression, and love them no matter what. Activism can involve volunteering at a local LGBTQIA+ support center, volunteering with a national organization like PFLAG or the Trevor Project, patronizing LGBTQIA+ businesses, or any other way that suits your lifestyle. To support your child\u2019s right to self-expression, avoid trying to control what they wear (unless it\u2019s a matter of safety or appropriateness), respect their boundaries, give them opportunities to socialize with other LGBTQIA+ peers if possible, and support their continued self-reflection and growth. Finally, the core part of your approach should be to lead with love; in a world that constantly invalidates LGBTQIA+ people, LGBTQIA+ children deserve to feel supported and loved within their immediate circle. That starts with you.\u00a0You\u2019re off to a great start seeking advice from a trusted source like this blog. While the advice inherently cannot be one size fits all, ongoing communication about your youth\u2019s specific needs will allow you to tailor it to your life. This is why it\u2019s vital to keep the lines of communication open, lead with love and non-judgment, and make your child feel safe so they can trust you with their needs. You won\u2019t get everything right on the first try and that\u2019s okay. Your best is enough and as long as you\u2019re trying, that\u2019s all anyone can ask of you.<|endoftext|>"}

At the midpoint of the novel, Orlando, now an ambassador in Constantinople, awakes to find that he is a woman, and the novel indulges in farce and irony to consider the roles of women in the 18th and 19th centuries.

We hope you take advantage of these resources in your Pride Month education and onward.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "embracesexualwellness", "text": "<|endoftext|>3 Ways to Queer Your Relationship\n\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re aware of it or not, societal expectations and social systems of oppression, like white supremacy, capitalism, patriarchy, laws, and more heavily influence how we form relationships. For instance, the rise of the isolated nuclear family (two parents and their children living together) as opposed to interconnected extended families was prompted following the Great Depression and World War I. This was due in part to the fact that it allowed for the proliferation of generational wealth - to the disadvantage of the working class. This is one example of many that illustrates how social institutions (in this case, capitalism) have shaped modern relationship norms. Unfortunately, this limits people from achieving their most fulfilling relationship dynamic. It\u2019s never too late to start unlearning toxic societal ideals though!\u201cQueering\u201d is difficult to define because the nature of queerness is ambiguous. It started as a method of media analysis that utilizes queer theory to reinterpret and challenge heteronormativity and gender roles in popular media. More broadly, it refers to challenging the societal norms and institutions that oppress anyone who dares to exist in opposition to them. That\u2019s still a bit nebulous so let\u2019s talk about what the \u201cqueering\u201d of a relationship tangibly looks like:\n\n1. Let go of heteronormative ideas of how relationships functionHeteronormativity is \u201cthe assumption that heterosexuality is the standard for defining normal sexual behavior and that male-female differences and gender roles are the natural and immutable essentials in normal human relations.\u201d To be clear, challenging heteronormativity does not mean invalidating heterosexuality but rather the toxic assumption that heterosexuality is the only valid way to exist. Rejecting heteronormativity in your relationship might look like confronting your assumptions about sexuality in general; intentionally evaluating whether the heteronormative version of \u201cnormal relationships\u201d is right for you in. Heteronormativity is strict in its expectation that the only valid romantic relationships exist between a cisgender, heterosexual man and woman in a monogamous relationship. Unsurprisingly, this script does not suit as many people as it claims to but because it is ingrained as the \u201cdefault\u201d option, many people simply don\u2019t even realize there are alternatives to be considered. If you haven\u2019t already done soul searching surrounding your own desires in terms of your sexuality and your preferences for monogamy or non-monogamy, that is an important first step.\n\n2. Let go of binary gender rolesBinary gender roles are a byproduct of heteronormativity in which all people are classified as one of two genders, male or female, typically decided based on the appearance of genitalia at birth. This is a rigid understanding of the concepts of sex and gender which attempts to pigeonhole people based on arbitrary assumptions pertaining to one\u2019s gender. An example of how gender roles manifest is the assumption that women will want to be homemakers and men will be breadwinners. Unlearning these ingrained ideas about gender essentialism is no easy task. It involves reconsidering everything we have been told is \u201cnormal.\u201d It\u2019s worthwhile to sit down with your partner(s) and evaluate how gender roles manifest in your relationship; do you make assumptions about one another\u2019s preferences based on their gender? Does everyone feel safe to express their gender identity authentically around one another? Do you surround your relationship with people who help you outgrow the limitations of the gender binary?\n\n3. Intentionally create a relationship that fulfills the needs of all involvedHere are some questions to consider with your partner(s):\u00a0Is everyone involved in the relationship satisfied with its status regarding monogamy? Would it benefit the relationship to consider alternative structures like a form of non-monogamy?If anyone in the relationship is queer, do they feel validated in their identity within the relationship?Do you prioritize your romantic relationship(s) over platonic ones? If so, why, and does that serve you?\u00a0\u00a0Queerness, and queering, are very nuanced concepts that cannot be done full justice in a singular blog post. You might consider speaking to a therapist at Embrace Sexual Wellness if you\u2019re struggling to get started with queering your relationship. If you\u2019re interested in learning more on your own, here are some resources:Queer Relationships ZineThe Joys of Queering Your RelationshipsQueering Relationships: Toward a Paradigmatic ShiftQueering Gender, Queering RelationshipsHow To \"Queer\" A Heterosexual RelationshipMy Queer Friendships Taught Me How to Lovequeering heterosexuality | The Anarchist LibraryQueering Relationships: Aromantic and Asexual PerspectivesQueering Marriage: The Homoradical and Anti-NormativityQueering Marriage | Rutgers University PressQueering RelationshipsQueering intimacies, families and companionships<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "embracesexualwellness", "text": "<|endoftext|>Questioning Your Gender, Now What?\n\n\n\nSo, you read our last blog post about gender and sexuality and after some self-reflection, you\u2019ve got questions. Or maybe you\u2019ve had questions for a while and are feeling a bit lost. Either way, lucky for you, you\u2019ve got questions and we\u2019ve got answers! Gender is an extremely complex concept; because it\u2019s so deeply ingrained in every aspect of Western society, it can be difficult to divest yourself from oppressive notions of gender that were forced on you. Questioning your gender and your place in a world structured around gender binaries is a scary prospect and it\u2019s okay to feel uncertain or uncomfortable.\n\nAt the end of the day, this journey is for you and you only, with the ultimate goal being you feeling comfortable in your own skin. You deserve happiness and gender euphoria. There is nothing wrong or broken about you. There is no right way to be a particular gender therefore you can never be wrong.\u00a0If you\u2019re struggling to get started, here are some points to consider:If you\u2019re considering changing facets of your identity like your name or pronouns, a good way to see if they fit is by \u201cpiloting\u201d them with a group of trusted friends or family. This way, you don\u2019t need to commit to a public announcement before you\u2019re sure of yourself.\u00a0It\u2019s never too late to question and explore!\u00a0You don\u2019t need to have dysphoria or a desire to transition in order to be transgender or non-binary.There\u2019s no deadline for figuring yourself out. Give yourself the grace of time to figure things out.\u00a0You may never arrive at a final destination; navigating and understanding gender identity is a complex and lifelong process.\u00a0Don\u2019t get caught up in a need for labels and codification. Though labels can certainly be comforting, they may also be limiting.\u00a0You will almost inevitably experience confusion at some point and that\u2019s not your fault; when you pick apart the way gender structures society, you will begin to see that there are a lot of holes in the logic underlying it which makes rearing up against those expectations so confusing and difficult.\u00a0If it\u2019s accessible to you, don\u2019t go it alone. Whether that means seeing a gender therapist, finding support groups either online or in person, or just talking it out with a trusted individual, you deserve external support throughout this process.\u00a0Institutions that you may have been taught were created to help you like medicine and education have ingrained systemic transphobia. While there are certainly individuals within these institutions that may be genuinely accepting and helpful, this is likely not the case for the majority of people you interact within these contexts, particularly depending on your specific geography.\u00a0If you find yourself self-invalidating your gender questioning process because you don\u2019t feel genderqueer/trans \u201cenough\u201d but you wish you were (insert gender identity), that is indicative of that identity fitting you. Wanting to be a certain gender is a \u201csymptom,\u201d for lack of a better word, of being that gender.\u00a0\ufeffAdditionally, questioning is a valid identity. You might not want to be a certain gender and that is also telling and legitimate. The beauty of questioning the gender binary is that there are no wrong answers, nor does there have to be an answer in the first place. Questioning as an identity is every bit as valid as any other label.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the day, try to find the balance between honoring your gender identity and not becoming overcome by the intricacies of navigating gender. Gender is performance in its most basic form and there are ways to make that performance fun. We didn\u2019t choose the gender binary that exists around us, but we can choose to make it work for each of us to the best of our ability by understanding what makes us feel liberated.\n\nInspired by Adrian Ballou\u2019s article, it is important to qualify that this article is being written from the perspective of a singular white genderqueer person which may influence the suggestions provided.<|endoftext|>"}

If you missed the previous ones, check them out on our blog. For the third installment in our interviews, we spoke with Casey Tanner (she/they), owner of The Expansive Group.Casey Tanner is an AASECT Certified Sex Therapist who combines evidence-based research, queer affirming care, and pleasure activism to cultivate powerful relationships. Specializing in gender and sexual diversity, she partners with individuals, relationships, and institutions to expand limited mindsets, foster courageous behavior, and empower meaningful change around gender and sexuality.\u00a0 After several individuals, couples and businesses sought out Casey\u2019s guidance in making cultural shifts around gender and sexuality, they started The Expansive Group to better meet the growing demand.Sex therapy is a type of psychotherapy focused specifically on sexual health, function, intimacy issues, and feelings, among other topics. While all sex therapists are formally trained, many but not all are officially AASECT-certified professionals. Typically, though not always, sex therapy is temporary, to address certain issues. Through sex therapy, you can learn to express your concerns clearly, better understand your own sexual needs and better understand your partner's sexual needs.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue your career path?\u00a0The life-changing experience of talking about sex and queerness with my own therapist.\u00a0 This space wasn't available to me until my early 20s and, for so many, is never available.\u00a0 I wanted to become the space that I needed growing up - everything I do is, in some ways, a love letter to my younger queer self.How does your field differ from that of other sexuality professionals?My field (the intersection of therapist, educator, influencer, and consultant) is brand new!\u00a0 While it's based on best-practices and evidence-based research from each of those individual fields, the combination feels like a new story that I'm writing every day.\u00a0 There's no (updated) guidebook on how to balance the confidentiality ethics of being a therapist with the nuance of being an educator/influencer.\u00a0 One of the more unique parts of my job is working with companies who want to do a better job around gender neutral language - I think of it as a sort of large-scale therapy for businesses!What is the most rewarding part of your career?Receiving feedback from my audience, students, or team that the space I'm creating means something to them. I get a lot of feedback that folks haven't seen anything like this before, and that really validates the \"why\" behind the work.What's the most misunderstood thing about what you do?That being a gender/sexuality professional means I have my own relationships and identity figured out. Surprise - I don't!What's the most common question you receive from others about your career?People often ask me what \"queer sex\" is. I usually respond with, \"queer sex is intimacy that expands beyond the binary - it challenges our ideas on what is or isn't sex, what is or isn't normal, what is or isn't allowed.\"What advice would you want to share with aspiring sexuality professionals?To the extent possible, choose supervisors with a sexuality/queer background. I think direct supervisors are more important than the workplace itself, so don't silo yourself into only working in sexuality-focused practices. If you're able, do an administrative internship with a therapist or educator before graduate school so that you have a great letter of recommendation when it comes time for practicum applications.If you had to describe your work in one sentence, what would you say?I expand folks' ideas of what healthy sexuality looks like to include more diversity and more pleasure.Thank you to Casey for taking the time to share their perspective.

If you missed the previous ones, check them out on our blog. For the fourth installment in our interviews, we spoke with Erica Smith (she/her) of Erica Smith Education and Consulting.Erica Smith spent 17 years working as a sex educator, advocate, and HIV prevention counselor for justice involved youth in Philadelphia, specifically young women and LGBTQ+ youth. Now she offers sexuality education that is tailored specifically to people raised in Purity Culture. Her clients were raised in incredibly restrictive and conservative religious environments that pathologize normal and healthy sexual behavior. Two years ago she started the Purity Culture Dropout Program, where she gives folks all of the medically accurate, queer inclusive, trauma informed, and shame free sex ed that they were denied.Sex education is a profession that has a wide variety of forms. Some work in a more formal capacity like a school or non-profit, others work freelance. Some choose to become certified, others do not. Some utilize digital media as their main platform, some do mostly in-person work. Some work with youth, others work with adults. Most sex educators have a niche, a few topic areas that they specialize in. For Erica, her focus is battling purity culture.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue your career path?\u00a0I majored in Women's Studies in college and especially loved the classes on women's health and sexuality. I was very active in feminist politics in school, and my friends and I put on a few sexuality related events that drew a lot of controversy (this was the late 90s at Penn State). I loved doing these events and talking and learning about sexuality. There's nothing else I've ever wanted to do, honestly.\u00a0How does your field differ from that of other sexuality professionals?As far as I know, I'm the only sex educator who focuses specifically on people raised in purity culture; at least this is what I've been told by many prominent ex-Evangelical mental health professionals who also do purity culture work!\u00a0What is the most rewarding part of your career?The most rewarding part of my career is witnessing people's lives be truly transformed by the power of sexuality education. Sex education is transformative. It's a social justice issue. Good sex education is power.\u00a0What's the most misunderstood thing about what you do?That it's all\u2026 sexy. That I'm just teaching people the best oral sex techniques and talking about the mechanical aspects of sexual intercourse all day. I am happy to do that stuff and it absolutely comes up, but I'm doing so much more work around things like sexual values, shame, cultural messaging, gender roles and expectations, and things that are quite far from sexually arousing to be honest! Sexuality is such a large topic that touches on so many different aspects of our lives, and the actual act of sex is a rather small part of it.\u00a0\u00a0What's the most common question you receive from others about your career?People most often ask how I got started in this field or why I focus on purity culture when I wasn't raised in it.What advice would you want to share with aspiring sexuality\u00a0professionals?That we need more sex educators and that there isn't only one path to becoming one! We need sex educators with a whole variety of experiences and backgrounds and identities.If you had to describe your work in one sentence, what would you say?I help people understand themselves and their place in the world better through educating them about sexuality.\u00a0Is there anything you\u2019d like to add?\u00a0Yes! I find social media's role in sex education to be so fascinating. It's a gift. There is great sex ed being put out there by so many people and organizations. This access changes peoples\u2019 lives.\u00a0Thank you to Erica for taking the time to share her perspective.

If you missed the previous installments, check them out on our blog. For the final installment in our interviews, we spoke to Haley Hasen, educator and erotic laborer (Haley/Haley\u2019s).Haley Hasen is the founder of Haleyhasenuncensored, LLC. Haley is an artist, sex educator, certified crisis interventionist, erotic laborer, and sex toy enthusiast. Haley is involved with a federal work-study with RAINN, and is an art therapy intern at the nonprofit Clean and Sober Street based in DC. Haley is studying to receive a Master\u2019s Degree in Art Therapy at George Washington University through a trauma-informed lens.\u00a0Erotic labor refers to any kind of sex work. This could be stripping, full service sex work, selling erotic photographs and videos, or any other kind of work that involves sex or eroticism in some capacity. The word \u201cprostitution\u201d is an outdated and generally disparaging term which should be avoided unless someone explicitly identifies themself as such. Erotic labor is highly stigmatized which can make these careers risky because of the lack of safeguards and regulation. At the end of the day, everyone under capitalism has to sell some part of themselves and erotic laborers are no different. Erotic labor is an entirely legitimate and valid career that does not deserve the flack it receives.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue your career path?\u00a0I feel I came about this career path while working on healing and unlearning my sexual trauma. I really appreciate Carl Jung's idea of being a \"wounded healer.\" I hope to create a safer space for individuals to be able to process, heal and unlearn aspects of themselves. I decided to do erotic labor as a way to reclaim my autonomy and sensuality after my sexual trauma. I wanted to have full control over that identity and I feel empowered by this aspect.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How does your field differ from that of other sexuality professionals?My field is different due to what I choose to disclose, educate, and advocate for. I am working within the here and now framework. I am also transparent in certain spaces about my identity as an erotic laborer; however, in most spaces I keep this identity hidden due to societal views and protection of myself. I feel I overlap in all aspects of myself and I try to formulate a truer self with one identity instead of being a multi-hat person.\u00a0What is the most rewarding part of your career?Empowering and creating a safer and healing space for sex workers and individuals who have and are experiencing sexual trauma. I enjoy learning from others and how they present themselves in these spaces.\u00a0What's the most misunderstood thing about what you do?I am not always turned on and I do not only think about sex. Furthermore, while I have gone through trauma that is not the reason I entered this space. I entered it to empower and reclaim aspects of me that were taken away without my consent.\u00a0What's the most common question you receive from others about your career?\u201dCan you teach me how to have sex?\u201d is usually peoples\u2019 go-to question on various dating apps and it always makes me roll my eyes.\u00a0What advice would you want to share with aspiring sexuality\u00a0professionals?You cannot educate everyone! I learned this from a dear colleague, Lindsay Wynn.\u00a0If you had to describe your work in one sentence, what would you say?Relevant.Is there anything you\u2019d like to add?\u00a0Pay, support and uplift Black and Brown Trans Sex Workers; they are the foundation of the sexuality field and are rarely credited.\u00a0Thank you to Haley for sharing their knowledge and expertise with us!

To get an idea of what the sexuality industry is really like, Embrace Sexual Wellness interviewed several sexuality professionals from different backgrounds. We will be sharing their wisdom and insight with you in a series of blog posts spotlighting each professional. Our first participant is Dr. Shemeka Thorpe (she/her), co-founder of The Minority Sex Report and Sex Researcher at the University of Kentucky.Shemeka Thorpe, PhD is a sexuality researcher at the University of Kentucky. Her research focuses on the sexual well-being of Black women using sex-positive and intimate justice frameworks. She serves on the editorial board of the American Journal of Sexuality Education. Dr. Thorpe is the co-founder of the award-winning platform The Minority Sex Report, a platform created to provide representation in sexuality education primarily for Black and Native American women.Sexuality research as a field originated with Dr. Alfred Kinsey at the Indiana University at Bloomington. In 1948, Kinsey published his groundbreaking \u2014 and controversial \u2014 \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,\" which became a bestseller. \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\" was the even more controversial followup in 1953. Prior to this, the vast majority of formal research about human sexuality was scarce. The research that did exist was anecdotally based on patient-therapist interactions. Sex is such a quintessential and core aspect of human life and social interactions that it is necessary to explore its trends, changes, and variations from person to person. On a tangible level, sexuality research about reproductive health and adjacent topics informs the development of healthcare strategies, therapies, and other treatments.\u00a0\u00a0Sexuality researchers span a wide array of topics under the umbrella of human sexuality. For Dr. Thorpe, her main focus is the sexual wellbeing of Black women. To contextualize that further, a recent article she co-authored was entitled \u201cBlack Female Adolescents' Sexuality: Pleasure Expectancies, Sexual Guilt, & Age of Sexual Debut.\u201d It \u201cexamined individual and familial influences on Black female adolescents\u2019 sexual pleasure expectancies, sexual guilt, and age of sexual debut\u2026\u201d This type of research makes up the majority of her invaluable work on an underserved demographic.\u00a0In addition to her research, she co-founded The Minority Sex Report. This business both educates and conducts consultations in order to facilitate better representation in sex education for people of color within an intersectional framework.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue your career path?\u00a0Most of the research on Black people focuses on prevention and operates from a deficit based model. I want to change the narrative of Black sexology by focusing on sexual well-being particularly of Black women. Who better to do that than myself, a Black woman?How does your field differ from that of other sexuality professionals?There are a lot of sex researchers and we are all in different fields like public health, counseling, social work, sociology, women and gender studies, and the like. We all come together to advance sex research, but examine our research questions through different lenses.\u00a0What's the most misunderstood thing about what you do?That I solely focus on pregnancy and STI prevention as a sexuality educator or HIV and STI prevention as a sex researcher. I believe in comprehensive sex positive sex education and my research is sex positive focusing on Black women's overall sexual well-being, not prevention.\u00a0What is the most rewarding part of your career?The most rewarding part is creating a space for Black women to discuss sexuality and sexual problems including sexual anxiety and sexual pain. Many women have expressed they wish they had this information when they were younger or that this is there first time talking about these tough topics because they don't have a safe space to talk about sex.\u00a0What advice would you want to share with aspiring sexuality professionals?There is always room for more sexuality professionals. Be yourself and find your niche.If you had to describe your work in one sentence, what would you say?Making research relevant.Thank you to Dr. Thorpe for taking the time to share her perspective.

Stressors can be found all around us, especially now. Did you know that many people who experience stress do not complete their stress cycles? According to Psych Central, stress isn\u2019t a one-time event with a single cause and reaction; it is a cycle with many phases. We complete a stress cycle when our bodies learn that we are safe after facing danger.Drs. Emily & Amelia Nagoski emphasize the importance of completing the stress cycle in their book, Burnout: The Secret to Solving the Stress Cycle. According to Burnout, when we do not confront our stress, we continue the stress cycle and our bodies are in constant activation with increased blood pressure, increased chance of heart disease, and issues with digestion. Thus, completing the stress cycle is imperative for our health.\n\nAccording to an article on Psych Central, there are five main stages of the stress cycle. These stages are, in order, the external stressor, internal appraisal, physiological response, internalization, and coping.\u00a0Stage One: The external stressor, or simply, the triggering event, is the only aspect of stress that your mind and body do not play a direct role in.\u00a0Stage Two: Internal appraisal happens just before, during, or after the actual trigger occurs. At this stage, your senses are taking in information that something has gone awry, sending a signal to your amygdala (the part of your brain that is responsible for processing emotions such as fear and rage). Once the amygdala is activated, a signal is sent to the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, which are responsible for maintaining homeostasis (balance in the body).Stage Three: Physiological responses occur once the amygdala is activated. Once the hypothalamus and the pituitary glands are signaled by the amygdala, the sympathetic nervous system becomes activated, thus launching your body into the fight or flight response. This response stimulates the cardiovascular system while accelerating your heart rate. At the same time, your parasympathetic nervous system is suppressed, causing your immune and digestive systems to shut down.\n\nStage Four: Internalization is when you begin to become aware of the stress. In this stage, you could experience physical reactions such as increased heart rate, upset stomach, or body aches which become more noticeable than in stage four. These physical reactions may cause you to worry about how well you are handling the stress, thus causing you to feel worry, anxiety, and dread.\u00a0Stage Five: The final stage of the cycle is coping, a.k.a., doing something that alleviates the discomfort. While some coping mechanisms decrease stress, others can increase it. This is called maladaptive coping. When people engage in maladaptive coping, their strategies may work in the short-term but not in the long term. Some of these mechanisms include consuming psychoactive drugs, alcohol, constantly checking your phone, mindless media, and throwing yourself into work. These coping mechanisms actually further activate the physiological stress responses in your body, causing you to stay in a hyper-aroused state, thus leading to more stress.\u00a0In an interview on Brene Brown\u2019s podcast, Unlocking Us, the Nagoski sisters spoke about the burnout phenomenon in relation to stress cycles. They emphasize how emotions and stress can impact your entire nervous system. In order to create balance in your nervous system, you have to complete the stress cycle. Emily Nagoski debunks the idea that if we fix the issue that caused the stress, we have dealt with the stress itself. In reality, when we do this, we stay in a chronically elevated state of stress.\u00a0In order to complete the stress cycle, we must reduce the stress we are experiencing. There is no one surefire way to reduce stress, but the Nagoski sisters do offer some helpful suggestions. Moving, breathing, laughing, speaking with your loved ones, crying, or doing something creative can have a profound impact on reducing stress.Let\u2019s Break These DownMoving can include any physical activity such as running, yoga, stretching, walking, or biking. According to the Nagoski sisters, any activity that moves the body is helpful.Breathing regulates your nervous system by increasing the amount of oxygen in your bloodstream. In fact, a study published in the Breathe, a journal published by the European Respiratory society, there appears to be potential for controlled slow breathing methods to optimize physiological health. The Nagoskis recommend taking a slow breath in and a slow, long breath out when you are feeling stressed. This is called paced breathing, and apps such as Insight Timer, Calm, and Headspace can help you practice this method. Breathing will engage the parasympathetic nervous system, therefore regulating the central nervous system. You may notice that you are unable to stay focused on one thought when you are breathing in this way, and that is normal. In fact, that\u2019s the point. If your thoughts are more steady, that is okay too.\n\nAny positive social interaction can help reduce stress. When you have a positive social interaction, your body feels as if it is at home. This interaction could be super brief such as saying hello to a cashier, or complimenting a neighbor or passerby, or talking to your best friend.According to Nagoski and Nagoski (2019), laughter will help alleviate stress, but only if it is authentic. In their podcast interview, Dr. Amelia Nagoski shared, \u201cit has to be the slightly embarrassing, mouth hanging open, belly jiggling, uncontrolled, ridiculous laughter that really takes over your body, you can\u2019t stop laughing. That laughter will take you all the way through the end of a stress cycle.\u201dThe next suggestion is to engage in affection. This can include speaking to a loved one or hugging (safely). According to an article in the Harvard Health newsletter, hugging for 20 seconds can increase your oxytocin levels. Higher oxytocin levels have been correlated with lower blood pressure and heart rates. Therefore, there is a possible link between hugging and lower blood pressure.\n\nCrying will not solve the problem, but it can help allow physical tension to leave your body.Creative expression can mean whatever you want it to mean, including painting, knitting, sketching, writing, singing, baking, or anything else that is an act of creation.\n\nWhile none of these stress-reduction methods are the end-all-be-all, they can help you to complete the stress cycle. The most important thing is that you make it through the stress cycle, to protect your physical and mental health.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "embracesexualwellness", "text": "<|endoftext|>The Danger of Gender Reveal Parties\n\n\n\nThe term \u201cgender reveal party\u201d has recently been trending due to an uncontrolled California wildfire caused by one of these events. Many are now wondering if we should even be having these parties at all. Here are some of the dangers of gender reveal parties.\u00a0What you are revealing is the child\u2019s assigned sex, not their genderJust the name of gender reveal parties are inaccurate. Gender and sex are often used interchangeably, when in fact they have different meanings. Gender is the socially constructed set of roles and behaviors that influence how we identify ourselves and others. Gender identity is fluid, meaning that there are gender identities that do not fit into our preconceived notions of woman and man, such as non-binary,\u00a0 genderqueer, two-spirit, and more. Sex assigned at birth, on the other hand, refers to the biological makeup of a person. Sex assigned at birth refers to a combination of chromosomes, genitalia, internal reproductive organs, sex hormones, gametes, and secondary sex characteristics. While sex assigned at birth can be determined before and during birth, gender cannot.\n\nThey place children within the binaryThese parties do not only misrepresent what gender is, but they place children in the gender binary before they are born. When we place children in the binary, we don\u2019t only take away much of their ability to grow and explore their own gender identity, but we teach them that the binary is the norm. But the binary is not the norm anymore. A 2017 study reported that 0.73%\n\nof American teenagers self-identify as transgender nationwide. And about 25-35% of those that are transgender identify as non-binary, meaning that they do not identify with either gender.\u00a0If we begin to go beyond the binary, we can give our future children the ability to decide how they want to express themselves and identify. Parents can give their children a diversity of choices and opportunities to develop their gender identity. Rather than giving children who are assigned female at birth \u201cfeminine\u201d toys, provide them with a range of toys to play with so that they can see what they enjoy for themselves. Not all \u201cgirls\u201d like dolls and not all \u201cboys\u201d like sports. And maybe your child isn\u2019t a girl or a boy, and that is okay. But give your children room to grow on their own.\n\nThey perpetuate gender stereotypes\u00a0Parents should let their children discover who they are without projecting their stereotypes of gender onto them. The blue or pink at a gender reveal represents more than assigned sex, it represents a childhood of constant stereotyping. When a parent reveals the assigned sex of their child, what follows is often a flood of gifts and advice relating to the child\u2019s perceived gender. Like the toy example, gifts and advice are harmful because they assume that there are correct interests and life paths for a child based on their assigned sex.\u00a0This leads to concepts such as the tomboy identity, culturally defined as a \u201cgirl\u201d who acts like a \u201cboy\u201d. But why even have these stereotypes? Interests and behaviors should not be gendered, and by beginning to gender interests and behaviors before a child is born, parents perpetuate these gendered stereotypes that can be harmful to children trying to navigate their own identities.\u00a0They are physically dangerousNot only are these parties dangerous socially and culturally, but they are also dangerous physically. Last week, a family in California set off a \u201csmoke-generating pyrotechnic device\u201d which caused an ongoing fire in the California wilderness. This fire has continued to spread uncontrollably and California skies have turned orange due to the fire. This phenomenon of gender reveals causing physical injuries is not new, methods for the \u201cbig reveal\u201d of a child\u2019s assigned sex have caused physical injuries and disasters on many occasions.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that we should cancel parties honoring a future child. However, we should be careful about the language that we are using and refrain from defaulting to societal norms surrounding stereotypes and the idea of the binary.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "embracesexualwellness", "text": "<|endoftext|>The Mindfulness and Pleasure Connection\n\n\n\nHave you ever found yourself running on autopilot? Waking up and going through the motions, each day without really thinking about the task at hand. If this sounds like you, don\u2019t be alarmed, almost half of the population is \u201cmentally checked out\u201d. We all have the potential to be more present in the moment, the hard part is remembering to do it.Maybe you have heard of mindfulness but never understood exactly what it meant or how to even be mindful, and that's okay. Mindfulness has been in practice for centuries and was originally a Buddhist concept brought to the Western mainstream by Jon Kabat-Zinn. In his book, Meditation Is Not What You Think: Mindfulness and Why It Is So Important, Kabat-Zinn states that we can no longer ignore the new possibilities that emerge out of our yearnings when we are true to ourselves. This cultivation of mindfulness can contribute to our lives in so many ways including our health and sexual wellbeing. Researcher Lori Brotto defines mindfulness as \u201cpresent moment nonjudgmental awareness\u201d, and participating in the moment versus being a spectator judging your performance.\n\nJudgment of your body can contribute to sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction. By incorporating a daily mindfulness practice into your routine you can begin to calm the chatter in your mind. According to the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, being mindful may contribute to sexual wellness by allowing for intentional behavior, emtoional regulation, reduction in anxiety, and an increase in self esteem. Performance anxiety can affect people of all genders throughout their lifespan. When being intimate with yourself or a partner(s), thinking about your body in a negative way can be a real mood killer. For penis-having individuals the inability to be present can cause erectile dysfunction. By being a spectator in erotic situations you can diminish your ability to maintain an erection. Spectatoring refers to shifting your focus from the present moment, and evaluating yourself and sexual activity in a third person perspective. Focusing your attention on sexual performance instead of the present sensory experience can interfere with your sexual functioning and lead to erectile dysfunction.\n\nWhen you instead focus your thoughts on the here and now, your primary attention is on your body and physical sensations and pleasure. The muscles that surround the penis need to relax in order for dilation of the arteries to occur, which promotes an erection. By being mindful during sex you can alleviate \u201ccognitive interference,\u201d which is associated with a decrease in anxiety related to sex. Attending to physical sensations can enhance your sexual and romantic relationship.\u00a0For individuals with vulvas, mindfulness has been shown to decrease genital pain and sexual distress and bridge the mind-body disconnect. When the central nervous system is dysregulated by stress, central sensitization, and hormonal changes in the neuroendocrine system, this can cause the vulvar skin to change increasing sensitivity to pain. According to Brotto, interest and motivation for sex can all be impacted by negative body image, sense of self, comfort in partnership, and violation to your sense of safety. By practicing mindfulness, participants in Brotto\u2019s study reported an increase in \u201csexual function, including desire, arousal, orgasm,\u201d and overall psychological well being. Through increasing attention to the here and now, it may be possible to redirect any negative thoughts or judgments that may arise when in an intimate situation.\n\nRegardless of your gender identity or relationship status, mindfulness can benefit your sexual wellbeing. We encourage you to experiment with different modalities of mindfulness. One of our favorite partnered mindfulness practices is sensate focus. This activity encourages you to actively focus on and communicate with your partner(s) about the sensation you are experiencing. By being fully present with your partner free from judgment, you can dive deeper into a state of erotic pleasure. Mindfulness is also something that you can practice on your own, by simply paying attention to your breath and any thoughts that may arise. There are a variety of apps available that can help guide you through this process. We are linking our favorites below:Headspace - Great for the whole family with hundreds of meditations to choose fromCalm - Focus in on what you want to meditate on with guided sessions between 3-25 minutes\u00a0\u00a0Insight Timer - Chart your progress and earn badges on your mindfulness journeyAura - Personalized meditations based on your moodSattva - Drawing its meditations from ancient Vedic principles, this app is perfect for anyone looking to get more in touch with the origin of mediationBuddhify - Perfect for those on the go (meditations for travel, dining, and more)Simple Habit - Traditional guided meditation mixed with coachingBreathing techniques are something you can do anywhere and at any time. By mindfully slowing the breath we engage the parasympathetic nervous system, which signals to our body it is time to calm down. Next time you are getting intimate with yourself or your partner(s) try taking a few minutes to intentionally slow your breath and practice mindfulness.<|endoftext|>"}
{"source": "embracesexualwellness", "text": "<|endoftext|>Understanding Gender and Sex\n\n\n\nGender and sex are far more complex than the binary categorizations presented to the majority of us in school. Gender and sex refer to, while tangentially related, two distinct concepts.\u00a0Gender is a social construct used to organize society that dictates expectations based on gender roles. In this sense, gender as a socially constructed organizational tool is more so a performance and what we do rather than what we inherently are. Though the widely accepted genders are limited to male and female, gender is far more fluid and multifaceted than that. Gender identity is specifically how one feels they align within the social construct of gender. For some, their gender may align with their sex assigned at birth which is the label one is given at birth based on perceived biology and other factors; when these two identities match, that makes a person cisgender. For those whose gender identity and assigned sex at birth differs, they are transgender.\u00a0The term \u201cassigned sex at birth\u201d differs from, for instance, \u201cbiological sex,\u201d because it acknowledges that the gender expectation was placed upon a newborn without their input and instead solely focuses on observable biological characteristics. This is a faulty method, however, because it fails to account for intersex people who don\u2019t exactly align with the biological expectations of women, nor men. Furthermore, as evidenced by the existence of transgender people, one\u2019s assigned sex and therefore, assigned gender role, is not always correct with how an individual internally feels.\n\nKEY TERMSGender: Broadly speaking, gender refers to the socially constructed characteristics of women and men \u2013 such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men. It varies from society to society and can be changed. When individuals or groups do not \u201cfit\u201d established gender norms they often face stigma, discriminatory practices or social exclusion \u2013 all of which adversely affect health.\u201d Furthermore, on an individual level, West and Zimmerman\u2019s \u201cDoing Gender\u201d delineates the idea that each person performs gender based on socially agreed gender expectations. Importantly, this idea focuses on gender as a psychologically trained set of behaviors, rather than innate qualities.\u00a0 \tAssigned Sex: Label (typically \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d) that one is given at birth based on one\u2019s biologyGender Role: Social role encompassing behaviors considered appropriate for an individual based on their perceived sex.Gender Expression: Notably distinct from gender identity, gender expression is how one presents themselves through clothing, hair, makeup, or any other visible characteristic. Though it typically aligns with one\u2019s internal understanding of gender identity, it does not necessarily need to.\u00a0Transgender: A person whose gender does not align with the label ascribed to their assigned sex at birth.Cisgender: A person whose gender aligns with their label ascribed to their assigned sex at birth.Non-Binary: A person who does not identify with either binary gender.Cissexism/cisgenderism: A system that presumes that people fall into one of two categories of gender, male and female. This system privileges those who subscribe to it and conform to it (cisgender people), while oppressing those who do not (transgender people).\u00a0Transphobia: Negative thoughts and actions taken against those who are trans and those who are perceived as transgender.\u00a0Transnormativity: The ideology and expectation that trans people are tolerated only if they adhere to traditional gender roles, gender expression, heteronormativity, and overall respectability politics. Though all transgender people face discrimination, the closer one aligns with transnormativity, the more socially \"acceptable\" they are deemed. This is the phenomenology that undergirds cissexism.\u00a0Intersex: General term for a variety of circumstances in which a person is born with reproductive anatomy that does not fit within the delineated binary understanding of sex.\u00a0Pronouns: Pronouns are the words we use to refer to someone in place of using their name. Common pronouns are she/her, he/him, and they/them, the latter of which, when used singularly, is gender neutral. Though these are the most frequently used, there are additional gender neutral pronouns such as ze/hir (pronounced \u201czee\u201d and \u201chere,\u201d respectively). Pronouns often align with one\u2019s gender identity, but pronouns do not equal gender and therefore knowing someone\u2019s gender does not necessarily indicate their pronouns, and vice versa. Using the correct pronouns is a part of basic respect.\u00a0BECOME A PRONOUN PROHow should I ask someone\u2019s pronouns?\u00a0A great way to go about this is by introducing yourself and your pronouns first. For instance, you could say something like, \u201cHi, my name is (name) and I use she/her pronouns. What are your pronouns, if you\u2019re comfortable sharing?\u201d\u00a0What if I need to refer to someone whose pronouns I don\u2019t know? \tGenerally speaking, using the gender neutral they/them is acceptable in these instances, until you learn their correct pronouns. You should never assume someone\u2019s pronouns based on your perception of them.\u00a0What if I make a mistake?That\u2019s okay! You\u2019re still learning and as long as you\u2019re trying, no one can fault you for that. It\u2019s natural to make mistakes. In response, do not make a big deal of it; simply apologize and thank the person who corrected you and move on. Making a bigger deal out of it can inadvertently burden the person you misgendered with your guilt.\u00a0What are some gender neutral alternatives to gendered language such as \u201cguys\u201d?\u00a0Instead of \u201cguys,\u201d try \u201cy\u2019all,\u201d \u201cfolks,\u201d or \u201cfriends.\u201d\u00a0Instead of \u201cbrother/sister,\u201d try \u201csiblings.\u201d\u00a0Instead of \u201cniece/nephew,\u201d try \u201cnibling.\u201d\u00a0Instead of \u201cma\u2019am/sir,\u201d try \u201cMx.\u201d (pronounced \u201cmix\u201d).\n\nThis is merely an introduction to some key concepts surrounding gender and sex. Below you\u2019ll find resources for further learning.\u00a0A Simple Way to Understand the Origin of Gender Roles\u00a0Alice Dreger: Is anatomy destiny? | TED TalkHere's Why the Gender Binary Hurts Us AllIf We Want Equality, Then We Must Stop Perpetuating Gender RolesThe Past, Present and Future of Gender NormsThe Danger of Gender Reveal Parties\u00a0Explained: Difference between gender, gender expression\u00a0The Struggles of Rejecting the Gender Binary\u00a0Understanding Non-Binary PeopleWhat Is Gender Expression?How Getting Dressed As A Non-Binary Individual Is A Political ActHow to use neopronouns in sentencesInclusivity tipsMap of Gender diverse CulturesMore on NeopronounsYou Could Never Misgender MeSex vs. Gender (USD)Types of Gender Identities\u00a0Since gender is something that affects us all, everyone, regardless of gender identity, deserves to understand the intricacies of the system that organizes society. Having a greater understanding of gender on a societal level allows us to understand ourselves better and how we each fit into the grand scheme of society. It also allows us to interact with one another in the most respectful way possible in order to validate each other\u2019s identities.<|endoftext|>"}

Our founder Jennifer spoke with the Chicago Tribune about this; as she put it, virtual sex can be \u201ca nice option for a lot of people (because) it can kind of provide an avenue for connection with another person in a way that is a little bit safer.\u201d Virtual sex isn\u2019t for everyone but can be an option for intimacy when in-person sex isn\u2019t safe.\u00a0In a study about COVID-19 and sexual wellbeing, the researchers reported \u201cTotal abstinence and self-gratification can be the safest measures, but not always practically feasible\u2026 People can be encouraged to engage in digital sex (such as sexting or video sex), with an eye for the safety concerns. The mutual consent of the partners is, however, an essential consideration.\u201d Let\u2019s talk about some of the considerations around virtual sex like boundaries, safety precautions, and how to get the most fun out of it!Discuss Boundaries Before Getting Hot and Heavy\tJust as with in-person sex, it is essential to establish boundaries, rules, terms of consent, and safe words.First, you should assess your own comfort level. How much do you trust this partner(s)? What are you comfortable sending; text, video chat, phone calls, photos, videos? How will you mitigate risk of leaked virtual sex (we\u2019ll talk about risk reduction later!)? Are you willing to risk your words/photos being potentially exposed, even if you take every precaution? Is the risk/benefit worth it? When you and your partner(s) have assessed these questions independently, you can move on to discussing them together. This can feel awkward but if you aren\u2019t comfortable enough setting boundaries with a partner, you shouldn\u2019t be getting intimate with them. Discussing boundaries may help you feel more comfortable overall because you don\u2019t need to worry whether or not your partner(s) into something you want to share or if they might accidentally say something that would upset or trigger you. I find that discussing boundaries beforehand makes me feel a lot more comfortable because I don\u2019t have to worry if they\u2019re into something I want to share or if they\u2019ll accidentally trigger me.\u00a0Here are some potential boundaries you might want to consider:\u00a0Some things I enjoy are ______. Some things I do not enjoy are _______.\u00a0To build on this, set your \u201csoft limits\u201d and \u201chard limits.\u201d The former is something you\u2019re not actively interested but might consider if a partner was into it. The latter is something you are not willing to do under any circumstance.\u00a0No sharing any content with outsiders without explicit permission from the participating partner(s).\u00a0When and how you want to initiate virtual sex.Define what sorts of content (e.g. the medium used, the fantasies referenced)you are open to sharing and what you are open to receiving from your partner(s).\u00a0No Matter How Much You Trust Your Partner(s), Take Safety Precautions\tIt makes the most sense, in terms of mitigating the risk of a breach of trust, to engage in virtual sex with someone you have a history with and who you know you trust. That being said, even best laid plans may go awry; it\u2019s not fun to think about, we realize. What if in a few months you and your partner(s) have a messy fight or breakup? How certain are you that they wouldn\u2019t seek revenge by violating the boundaries you discussed? This is why, even with your most trusted partners, you should consider safety precautions. Here are some ideas:\u00a0Using an encrypted, safe app from the outset is the easiest way to protect your data. While Apple values privacy and does a decent job at securing your data (Android not as much), all messages in iMessage are automatically synced to the cloud. Your best bet for sending photos is to use encrypted service when sending nudes or when video chatting like Signal or Telegram. After sending a piece of sensitive media, you may opt to store it in a password protected app like these or delete it entirely.Do not show your face in photos; you can either blur it or crop it out. Note that some blurring can be undone by certain software. Check out this article by Vice discussing how to fully censor your face in an irreversible way. Additionally, consider editing out/excluding any identifiable markings like birthmarks or tattoos. Make sure that there is nothing that will identify you in the background like papers with your name on it.\u00a0\u201cCode\u201d your photos with a different color or filter for each sexual partner you are sending them to. This way, in the event that it is leaked, you will know who did it.\u00a0Unless you have set boundaries to account for this beforehand, don\u2019t sext when you\u2019re under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs such as marijuana because your judgment is impaired in this state and you might regret something you said or did in the morning.\u00a0For more safety precautions, check out this thorough article. This may seem like a lot of work and it can be; you can choose to take one, some, all, or none of these precautions. Just remember that if you choose not to implement every security measure, you are at higher risk of having your nudes, with identifiable information that can be traced back to you, leaked publicly. It sounds scary when you\u2019re digesting all these safeguards at once, and there is no foolproof way to exchange sensitive content, but with a few simple tweaks in your routine, you can minimize your risk.Have Fun With It!Of course, having just discussed setting boundaries and putting safety measures in place, sexting can feel overwhelmingly risky which might make you feel like it\u2019s not worth it. That\u2019s a personal decision for you to make, but it is possible to have safe and fun virtual sex! The best part of virtual sex, in this author\u2019s opinion, is that it\u2019s the best of both partnered sex and masturbation! You get the intimacy and thrill of engaging with another person sexually while satisfying yourself (if you choose to do so) by masturbating, and who knows your body better than you? Here are some ways to get the most out of your steamy virtual sesh:\u00a0Set the mood. Turn on some ambient lighting, get some massage oil, make a sexy playlist. You can also use props! Sex toys, lingerie, candles, chocolates, whatever makes you feel good (and sexy!).If you both consent to this beforehand, surprise each other with a teasing sext or a flirtatious photo throughout the day to build up anticipation for the virtual sex. Try saying things like\u2026\tI was just thinking about you doing ______ to me.\u00a0Want to hear a fantasy of mine?\u00a0Thinking about your (physical attribute) has me super distracted during work\u2026\u00a0Be detailed when you\u2019re telling your partner(s) what you want or what you\u2019re thinking about. The more detail, the better! No one wants to do all the work in a one-sided sexting session.Virtual sex might not be a perfect solution for these touch-starved times but it can definitely take the edge off. Happy sexting!<|endoftext|>"}

From insurance to personality compatibility to coordinating schedules, searching for the right mental health professional can be understandably overwhelming. This article is meant to guide you through the process, covering how to find the right fit, how to tell if they\u2019re the right fit, and how to measure quality of care.\n\nWhere to begin your searchWord of mouth is a great way to find therapists in your area, especially if the recommendation comes from someone who knows you and your needs well. If you do want to pursue a recommendation from a friend, make sure you check that it\u2019s not a conflict of interest to see the same therapist.\u00a0If you are insured, a good place to start is your insurance company\u2019s directory of in-network professionals.\u00a0If you are uninsured or you\u2019re looking for alternative search engine options, here are some alternative places to look for a therapist.Open Path Collective\u201cOpen Path Psychotherapy Collective is a nonprofit nationwide network of mental health professionals dedicated to providing in-office and online mental health care\u2014at a steeply reduced rate\u2014to clients in need.\u201d\u00a0Inclusive Therapists\u201cSeeking therapy can be a vulnerable process.

This space was developed to present mental health topics in a way that feels more accessible and relevant.\u201d\n\nConsiderations for your search parametersFinding the name of a therapist is one thing, but it\u2019s an entire other thing to find a therapist who works for you and your needs.\u00a0\u00a0When you\u2019re considering what might make a therapist a good fit for you, think first of whether or not you have any identity preferences such as gender or race that would allow a therapist to relate to certain experiences.\u00a0Before meeting with a therapist, try to do initial phone screenings of several options to ask about their specialties, whether they have experience with your specific issues, what structure their sessions usually follow, and any other information that you might need.\u00a0Logistical factors you may need to take into consideration are location, cost, mutual schedule availability, and the therapist\u2019s availability outside of sessions, such as for emergencies.\n\nHow to tell if they\u2019re the right fitYou feel comfortable being vulnerable around them (at least relative to others)\u00a0They have strong, clearly communicated boundaries about their policies and personal lifeYou are able to share concerns about the therapeutic relationship and they respond with openness and a desire to problem solve\u00a0They respect your values and identity\u00a0They guide you to your goals and coach you to be able to make your own decisions\u00a0They challenge you in constructive ways. For example, they might ask you to reconsider a self-deprecating statement and work to get to the root of the thought in order to unpack it\n\nSigns that they\u2019re not a good fitThey judge you or shame you\u00a0They have no experience with your issue(s)They overshare about themselvesThey tell you what to do rather than guiding you to make your own decisionsYou regularly feel worse after your session\n\nIt will take some time to find a therapist who works for you and when you\u2019re in need of help, that can be discouraging. Perhaps try asking a trusted friend or family member to aid you in your search and/or ask them to sit with you for moral support while you do it. Once you do find a good therapist, it will be worth it. Simply wanting to seek help is a huge first step so show yourself gratitude for taking the time to read this.

Here's How to Address Pelvic Pain\n\n\n\nThe pelvic floor muscles refers to the hammock-like musculature that supports your pelvic organs and therefore they are an essential part of executing bodily functions like ridding of stool and pee, and having sex. Like anything else in your body, they can weaken throughout the normal aging process leading to concerns like incontinence, or general pain and discomfort.\n\nDifferences between people assigned female versus male at birthEveryone has a pelvic floor regardless of their gender or reproductive anatomy. Pelvic floor health has different implications depending on the type of anatomy it\u2019s supporting. For people assigned female at birth (AFAB), the pelvic floor muscles support the uterus, bladder, and bowel, and the anus, vagina, and urethra all pass through this group of muscles. The pelvic floor is strongly involved in pregnancy and this is a common cause of pelvic floor dysfunction. For people assigned male at birth (AMAB), the pelvic floor muscles support the bladder and bowel, and the anus and urethra pass through them. Unfortunately, there is next to no research or information about transgender and intersex people and their pelvic floor health.\n\nCommon Pelvic Floor ConcernsHaving pelvic muscles that are too weak or too tight can cause concern; the idea is to find a balance. Pelvic floor concerns might be the cause of additional problems but it can also be a symptom of conditions like endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and menstrual cycle cramping.If untreated, pelvic floor imbalances can cause:Sexual dysfunctionSexual dysfunction conditions relating to pelvic floor health include dyspareunia (AFAB people) and erectile dysfunction (AMAB people).\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic painPelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) is \u201cthe inability to correctly relax and coordinate your pelvic floor muscles to have a bowel movement.\u201d It\u2019s more commonly experienced by people assigned female at birth. Symptoms associated with it in addition to pain (usually exacerbated by sexual intercourse or certain movements) are incontinence, bloating and constipation, and lower back pain.\u00a0Bladder concernsIf your pelvic muscles are too weak, you may struggle with a frequent urge to pee or an inability to hold in pee. This is often an aftereffect of pregnancy and giving birth.\u00a0Bowel problemsSimilar to bladder concerns, weak pelvic muscles sometimes struggle to hold in gas or poop, leading to bowel incontinence. On the other end, you might also experience constipation and straining pain when trying to poop.\n\nOptions for Addressing Pelvic Floor ConcernsMedicationMedication options will differ depending on the root cause of pelvic floor concerns. Hormonal based therapies like GnRH, Progestin, and oral contraceptives may be used to treat pelvic floor concerns associated with reproductive conditions such as endometriosis. For pain, over the counter medications like Tylenol can be used. If an infection is the source of pain, you may be prescribed antibiotics. Before starting any medication, discuss with your doctor to make sure it\u2019s the right route for you and that it won\u2019t cause adverse effects.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relaxation techniquesIf your pelvic floor is too tense, you might want to try relaxation techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing and pelvic girdle stretches.\u00a0Physical therapyIf your effort with pelvic floor exercises at home don\u2019t work for you or if you\u2019re just seeking professional guidance, physical therapy is a good option.\u00a0Pelvic floor exercisesKegels are the most well known pelvic floor exercise and they\u2019re a great way to strengthen those muscles. Click through on the link above to get more details on how to properly do pelvic floor exercises.\n\nPelvic floor health is a buzzy topic on social media these days, especially on TikTok. We would caution you against taking any of that advice prior to speaking with a qualified health professional who knows you personally. If your pelvic floor concerns are causing mental distress, consider seeing a sex therapist.
